Rules define limits on certain characteristics of a selection of indexes, and are applied before optimizing for the specified [goals](goals). The order of rules does not matter.

Note that applying rules that are too restrictive may cause the model to return an error, if the rule cannot be fulfilled.


### Maximum Per-Scan Cost Tolerance

**Default value: Unlimited**

The *Maximum Per-Scan Cost Tolerance* rule ensures that the cost of each scan is not worse than their best possible cost (taking into account a tolerance parameter).

If the tolerance were set to 0.5 (i.e., 50%), the cost of each scan would be assured to be no worse than 150% of their best possible cost. Suppose that the best cost of a certain scan is 20. With the tolerance set to 0.5, the cost of that scan in the solution could not be worse than 150% of 20, which is 30.

###  Maximum Per-Scan Impact Tolerance

**Default value: Unlimited**

The *Maximum Per-Scan Impact Tolerance* rule ensures that the impact of each scan is not worse than their best possible impact (taking into account a tolerance parameter). See [Maximum Per-Scan Cost Tolerance](#maximum-per-scan-cost-tolerance) for an example.

<CopyCodeBlock content={`"Maximum Per-Scan Impact Tolerance": 10.0`} language="json" />


### Maximum Number of Indexes

**Default value: Unlimited**

The *Maximum Number of Indexes* rule specifies a maximum number of indexes that can be selected by the model. This rule can be used in conjunction with the [Minimize Number of Indexes](goals#minimize-number-of-indexes) goal.

<CopyCodeBlock content={`"Maximum Number of Indexes": 16`} language="json" />


### Maximum Index Write Overhead

**Default value: Unlimited**

The *Maximum Index Write Overhead* rule specifies a maximum value for the total index write overhead of the indexes suggested by the model. This rule can be used in conjunction with the [Minimize Index Write Overhead](goals#minimize-index-write-overhead) goal.

<CopyCodeBlock content={`"Maximum Index Write Overhead": 1.0`} language="json" />


### Minimum Coverage

**Default value: 0.0**

The *Minimum Coverage* rule ensures that a portion of the coverable scans (at least as large as the value associated with this rule) are covered by the selected indexes. A *coverable scan* is a scan for which at least one index can provide coverage.

A scan is considered to be covered only if at least one of the selected indexes provides that scan with a cost improvement over its sequential read cost.

<CopyCodeBlock content={`"Minimum Coverage": 0.95`} language="json" />
