Rules define limits on certain characteristics of a selection of indexes, and are applied before optimizing for the specified [goals](goals). The order of rules does not matter.

Note that applying rules that are too restrictive may cause the model to return an error, if the rule cannot be fulfilled.


### Minimum Per-Scan Cost (Normal)

**Default value: Unlimited**

The *Minimum Per-Scan Cost (Normal)* rule ensures that the cost of each *normal* (i.e., *non-priority*) scan is not worse than a given threshold w.r.t. their best possible cost. A threshold of 1 is the minimum and ensures that each normal scan assumes their best possible cost.

If this threshold were set to 1.5 (i.e., 150%), the cost of each normal scan would be assured to be no worse than 150% of their best possible cost. Suppose that the best cost of a certain normal scan is 20. With the threshold set to 1.5, the cost of that scan in the solution could not be worse than 150% of 20, which is 30.


### Minimum Per-Scan Cost (Priority)

**Default value: Unlimited**

The *Minimum Per-Scan Cost (Priority)* rule ensures that the cost of each priority scan is not worse than a given threshold w.r.t. their best possible cost. A threshold of 1 is the minimum and ensures that each priority scan assumes their best possible cost.


### Maximum Number of Indexes

**Default value: Unlimited**

The *Maximum Number of Indexes* rule specifies a maximum number of indexes that can be selected by the model. This rule can be used in conjunction with the [Minimize Number of Indexes](goals#minimize-number-of-indexes) goal.


### Maximum Index Write Overhead

**Default value: Unlimited**

The *Maximum Index Write Overhead* rule specifies a maximum value for the total index write overhead of the indexes suggested by the model. This rule can be used in conjunction with the [Minimize Index Write Overhead](goals#minimize-index-write-overhead) goal.


### Minimum Coverage

**Default value: 0.0**

The *Minimum Coverage* rule ensures that a portion of the coverable scans (at least as large as the value associated with this rule) are covered by the selected indexes. A *coverable scan* is a scan for which at least one index can provide coverage.

A scan is considered to be covered only if at least one of the selected indexes provides that scan with a cost improvement over its sequential read cost.
