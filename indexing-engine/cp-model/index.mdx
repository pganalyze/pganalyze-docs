**Important:** The new constraint programming (CP) model for the pganalyze Indexing Engine and pganalyze Index Advisor is currently in early access. We are working with a small set of customers to refine the experience. You can [contact us](/contact) to inquire about joining the preview.

In the CP model, indexes are suggested based on user-defined goals and rules. You may want to cover as many scans as possible with the available indexes, or to make the costs of the scans as small as possible, or to stay within a given index budget, and so on.

These goals and rules can also be combinedâ€”for example, covering as many scans as possible while satisfying a budget of X indexes. Once the model is given a set of goals and rules, it then suggests the indexes that best fit with these requirements based on the available data.

The difference between a goal and a rule may appear subtle, but it is an important one:
- A goal *strives towards something*: "Make the costs of the scans as small as possible".
- A rule *sets a limit on something*: "Make sure not to use more than 3 indexes".

Learn more about the available [goals](/docs/indexing-engine/cp-model/goals) and [rules](/docs/indexing-engine/cp-model/rules), or see an example of the [settings](/docs/indexing-engine/cp-model/settings).
