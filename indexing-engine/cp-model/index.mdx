The Constraint Programming (CP) model for index selection helps deal with the fundamental
challenge of balancing the goals of reducing write overhead (less indexes = lower write overhead),
whilst increasing query performance (more indexes = better query performance / lower scan costs).

The model is configurable, and prioritizes different types and amount of indexes based on the
configuration. Behind the scenes the model is solved using the [CP-SAT solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver),
to find the optimum choice of indexes based on the selected goals.

## Learn more about the model

To learn all the details about the Constraint Programming Model, we recommend watching the webinar recording (56min)
that goes into details on how it works:

## Built-in configurations

[Depending on the workload](/docs/index-advisor/configurations), the Indexing Engine will automatically
default to one of the available built-in model configurations:

- [Write-optimized](cp-model/built-in-configs#write-optimized) (fewer indexes, higher scan costs)
- [Read-optimized](cp-model/built-in-configs#read-optimized) (more indexes, lower scan costs)
- [Balanced](cp-model/built-in-configs#balanced) (balance between the two goals)

## Custom configurations

Optionally, you can fully customize the configuration, to prioritize what makes sense for your unique workloads.

At a high level, indexes are suggested based on user-defined goals and rules. You may want to cover as many scans
as possible with the available indexes, or to make the costs of the scans as small as possible, or to stay within
a given index budget, and so on.

These goals and rules can also be combinedâ€”for example, covering as many scans as possible
while satisfying a budget of a specific number of indexes. Once the model is given a set of goals and rules,
it then suggests the indexes that best fit with these requirements based on the available data.

The difference between a goal and a rule may appear subtle, but it is an important one:
- A goal *strives towards something*: "Make the costs of the scans as small as possible".
- A rule *sets a limit on something*: "Make sure not to use more than 3 indexes".

Continue by reviewing the available [goals](/docs/indexing-engine/cp-model/goals) and
[rules](/docs/indexing-engine/cp-model/rules), or see an example of the [settings](/docs/indexing-engine/cp-model/settings).
