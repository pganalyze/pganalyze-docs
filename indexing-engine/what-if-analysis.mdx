When the Indexing Engine determines how useful a potential index is, it runs through
a process called "What if?" analysis, that uses the Postgres query planner, and
represents improvements using a "cost improvement" metric, as generated by the
Postgres code model.

## The Postgres cost model

When cost is shown it represents the total cost of performing the scan (i.e. to
retrieve all rows requested) with the currently available scan method
(Sequential Scan or Index Scan). This is the same notion of “cost” and “total
cost” you see when running an EXPLAIN (without ANALYZE) in Postgres. The “cost”
units are a unique measurement used for modeling only, and do not represent
time, or bytes.

The biggest contributor to the estimated cost for a Sequential Scan or Index
Scan is the estimated I/O for the scan. This is based on the Postgres cost
estimation functions used by the Postgres planner. You can read more about this
in [our recent blog
post](https://pganalyze.com/blog/how-postgres-chooses-index).

Note that the Index Advisor planning process utilizes your production
statistics, and therefore costs are based on the actual measured size of tables
and indexes, where possible.

When you see the Scans list on the Index Advisor opportunity page, each scan
expression includes information about the current cost, estimated scans per
minute, and weighted cost improvement if you were to apply the recommendation.
Cost improvements are expressed as a multiplier, for example: 1.2x faster
compared to the old estimated cost. The table is sorted by cost improvement.

## Potential cost improvement

During the Index Advisor recommendation process, different variants of indexes
are tried that overall produce the lowest cost (and thus the lowest estimated
I/O). When a recommendation is found, the Index Advisor will show an expected
cost improvement for the recommendation.

When the cost improvement is summarized across multiple scans, it is shown as
a weighted average across the individual cost improvements for each scan that
can benefit from the query, weighted by the frequency of the scan (based on the
queries that contain the scan). More frequent queries will have a bigger impact
on the overall weighted cost improvement number.

## How the "What if?" analysis works

In order to enable the Indexing Engine to run an analysis on the cost improvement
for a potential index recommendations, we run a modified variant of the Postgres
planner within the pganalyze app, with zero overhead on your production system.
