Before the Indexing Engine starts considering how to index your queries, it first
breaks down your query workload into a set of scans for each table referenced by
your queries.

These scans are the input into the Indexing Engine, and when trying to understand
how the Indexing Engine reached a conclusion, it helps to verify which scans were
extracted from your queries.

## Scans

What exactly are scans? Let’s look at an example, in a simple query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
  JOIN comments ON (users.id = comments.user_id)
 WHERE users.site_id = 123 AND comments.parent_id IS NULL
 ORDER BY comments.created_at DESC
 LIMIT 10;
```

This query has two scans:

- users:
  - WHERE clause: (site_id = $n)
  - JOIN clause: (id = $n)
- comments:
  - WHERE clause: (parent_id IS NULL)
  - JOIN clause: (user_id = $n)
  - ORDER BY clause: created_at

Each of these scans also has an associated average estimated cost, that is
averaged across all queries it’s referenced in. Note we replace specific values
and fields from other tables with the $n parameter reference for easier
grouping. 

More broadly, each scan consists of:

 - Zero or more WHERE clause conditions
 - Zero or more JOIN clause conditions
 - Zero or more an ORDER BY clause columns (Note: not yet considered by the Indexing
   Engine; see [Limitations](/docs/indexing-engine/limitations))
 - Optionally, a LIMIT on how much data needs to be returned (Note: not yet
   considered by the Indexing Engine; see [Limitations](/docs/index-advisor/limitations))

In case of JOIN conditions, we run the Postgres planner to determine whether a JOIN clause
is likely to be used as the inner relation of a Nested Loop, allowing use of a [parameterized index
scan](https://pganalyze.com/blog/how-postgres-chooses-index#parameterized-index-scans-or-why-nested-loop-are-sometimes-a-good-join-type).

If such a paramterized index scan is likely, we include the JOIN clause in the scan data provided
to the second phase of the Indexing Engine - otherwise JOIN clauses are excluded.
