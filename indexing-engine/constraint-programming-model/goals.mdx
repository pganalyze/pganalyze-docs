Goals are the main components that guide the optimizer toward the solution that best meets the requirements of the user. These requirements can be defined using any combination of goals.

### Minimize Index Write Overhead

The *Minimize Index Write Overhead* goal strives to minimize the index write overhead associated with the selected indexes.


### Minimize Number of Indexes

The *Minimize Number of Indexes* goal strives to minimize the number of existing and possible indexes selected.


### Minimize Total Cost

The *Minimize Total Cost* goal strives to minimize the combined costs of the scans.


### Minimize Maximum Cost

The *Minimize Maximum Cost* goal strives to minimize the largest cost found among the scans.


### Minimize Total Impact

The *Minimize Total Impact* goal strives to minimize the combined [impact](other-concepts#impact)s of the scans.


### Minimize Maximum Impact

The *Minimize Maximum Impact* goal strives to minimize the largest [impact](other-concepts#impact) found among the scans.

### Minimize Update Overhead

The *Minimize Update Overhead* goal strives to minimize the update overhead of the selected indexes.
