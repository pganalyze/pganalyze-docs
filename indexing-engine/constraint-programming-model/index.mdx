This document provides a high-level description of the *constraint programming model*, as well as enough low-level details to allow a user to tune it for their needs.

Creating indexes on a table in order to meet some requirements (performance, resource budget, etc) is typically done by hand. This optimizer is an automated tool that suggests a selection of good indexes to meet arbitrary user requirements.

Indexes are suggested based on a user's *goals* and *rules*. They may want to cover as many scans as possible with the available indexes, or to make the costs of the scans as small as possible, or to stay within a given index budget, and so on. These goals and rules can also be combinedâ€”for example, covering as many scans as possible while satisfying a budget of X indexes.  Once the optimizer is given a set of goals and rules, it then suggests the indexes that best fit with these requirements based on the available data.

The difference between a goal and a rule may appear subtle, but it is an important one:
- A goal *strives towards something*: "Make the costs of the scans as small as possible".
- A rule *sets a limit on something*: "Make sure not to use more than 3 indexes".
