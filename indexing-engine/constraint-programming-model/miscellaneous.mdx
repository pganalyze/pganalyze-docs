### CP Algorithm

Roughly, the CP algorithm works as follows:

1. Validate the data and the settings
2. Create a basic model
3. Add all the rules to the model
4. For each goal:
   - Optimize the goal
   - Transform the goal into a rule (taking tolerance into account)
5. Return the selection of indexes


### Greedy Algorithm

The greedy algorithm is the legacy method of solving the problem. Essentially, this algorithm considers index selection as a set covering problem, and seeks to cover all scans on the table with an index that is within 50% of the best possible index. This 50% value is customizable with the `Good Enough Threshold` option. The greedy algorithm is explained in more detail [here](../good-enough-index-selection).


### General Tips and Common Pitfalls

- The order of the goals always matters.

- Some goals should not be selected as the first goals to optimize.

  For example, suppose that the first goal is [Minimize Number of Indexes](#minimize-number-of-indexes). The optimizer is essentially told that "use the fewest indexes" is the most important goal. Obviously, 0 indexes is the fewest indexes it can use. Subsequent goals will not be able to make use of any indexes because of this.

  Goals that should be avoided as the first goal are [Minimize Number of Indexes](#minimize-number-of-indexes), [Minimize Index Write Overhead](#minimize-index-write-overhead), and [Minimize Update Overhead](#minimize-update-overhead)

- A scan is considered to be covered only if at least one of the selected indexes provides that scan with a cost improvement over its sequential read cost.
