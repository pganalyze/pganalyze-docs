On this page you can find changes made to the Indexing Engine itself, to help you
understand better when recommendations change due to a logic change in the
algorithm.

The dates on this page represent when features were first released for the cloud-based
version of pganalyze. For pganalyze Enterprise Server releases, we indicate on each
[release page](/docs/enterprise/releases) which release of the Indexing Engine is included.

## 2022-06-01

* Initial release of the new Indexing Engine, powering the in-app Index Advisor for pganalyze
  - This replaces the old Index Advisor logic, and represents a major change in how the query workload is assessed - the previous version worked on a per-query basis, this new version works on a per-table basis and assesses all queries referencing that table
  - Note that GIN index support is currently deactivated, as we improve how cost recommendations are represented for GIN
