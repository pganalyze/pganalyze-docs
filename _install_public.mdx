In order to use pganalyze you need to install the [pganalyze collector](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector)
in your environment, either on the database server directly, or a container / VM
close to it when using managed database services. The collector sends query data
and other statistics on a continuous basis to the pganalyze cloud service, or
to your pganalyze Enterprise Server installation.

The minimum supported PostgreSQL version is 10.
