[Personally Identifiable
Information](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/personally_identifiable_information)
(PII) about your users must be handled very carefully in order to respect your
users' privacy and to comply with laws and regulations your organization is
subject to. When a third-party tool like pganalyze processes your database
statistics and logs, it may involve handling data that includes this PII.

Specifically, pganalyze collects data that may include PII from Postgres logs,
the pg_stat_activity view, and the pg_stat_statements view.

Note that this filtering happens in the collector, the [open-source
agent](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/) that connects to your database
and runs on your infrastructure. Filtering occurs before the data ever reaches
the pganalyze cloud service, or a pganalyze Enterprise Server installation.

In order to strike the right balance between what you share with pganalyze and
the impact on monitoring, statistics, and insights available through our
service, there are several collector settings that control collection of
potentially sensitive information.

The default configuration may cause PII contained in query texts and parameter
values to be sent to pganalyze. However, Postgres credentials and log
information that could not be classified is redacted.

For servers containing sensitive information in the logs and to maximize data
privacy (at the cost of less useful data in pganalyze), we recommend the
following configuration:

```
filter_log_secret: all
filter_query_sample: normalize
filter_query_text: unparsable
```

## Filter settings

### Log secrets

**Setting**: `filter_log_secret` / `FILTER_LOG_SECRET`<br/>

This determines how content coming from logs is filtered:
 - `credential`: Text identified as passwords or other credentials, like private keys
 - `parsing_error`: Text logged by Postgres for parsing errors (could contain anything, including credentials)
 - `statement_text`: All statement texts (which may contain table data if not using bind parameters)
 - `statement_parameter`: Bind parameters for a statement (which may contain table data for statements like INSERT or UPDATE)
 - `table_data`: Table data from constraint violations and COPY errors
 - `ops`: System errors, network errors, file locations,
   [pg_hba.conf](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)
   contents, and configured commands (e.g. [`archive_command`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-COMMAND))
 - `unidentified`: Text that could not be identified and might contain secrets

Additionally, the special `all` and `none` setting values apply all or none of the above filters, respectively.

Defaults to `credential,parsing_error,unidentified`.

**Impact**: Filtered content from log lines visible in [Log Insights](/docs/log-insights)
  will show up as `[redacted]`.

### Query samples / Automated EXPLAIN

**Setting**: `filter_query_sample` / `FILTER_QUERY_SAMPLE`

This setting determines how content in query samples (individual executions of a
query collected from logs, which include [Automated EXPLAIN](/docs/explain/setup) plans) is filtered:
 - `all`: do not collect any query samples
 - `normalize`: filter query samples and collected EXPLAIN plans to remove any
   literal constant values and replace them with placeholders
 - `none`: do not filter query samples at all

In order to utilize `auto_explain` with the `normalize` value, make sure to set
`auto_explain.log_format` to `json` (other formats are currently not supported
by the EXPLAIN normalization).

Defaults to `none`.

**Impact**: Query samples and EXPLAIN plans shown in [Query
   Performance](/docs/query-performance) are filtered or normalized.

### Query texts

**Setting**: `filter_query_text` / `FILTER_QUERY_TEXT`

This setting determines how query text from pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_activity is filtered:
 - `none`: do not filter query text at all
 - `unparsable`: redact query texts that could not be parsed by the collector

Defaults to `unparsable`.

**Impact**: Unparseable queries are redacted in [Query
   Performance](/docs/query-performance) and [Connections](/docs/connections/)
   and may show as `<unparsable query>` or `<truncated query>`.
