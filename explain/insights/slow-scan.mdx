**Description:**

A sequential scan is a simple way to fetch data from a table, but unless you need a large fraction of the table data, itâ€™s rarely the most efficient. When a sequential scan in an EXPLAIN plan shows a large Rows Removed by Filter, this suggests it may be more efficient to fetch this data using an index.

**Recommended Action:**

Create an index (possibly a [partial index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html), an [expression index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-expressional.html), or using a specific [index type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html)) so a more efficient scan can be used instead. If indexes exist but are not being used, they may not be suitable for this query.
