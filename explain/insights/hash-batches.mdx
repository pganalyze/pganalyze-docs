**Description:**

When a Hash node builds a hash table, it may need to store a lot of table data in memory. If this runs up against `work_mem` limits, the algorithm can “spill” to disk and process data in batches. This ensures it can continue, but, as always, writing to disk during query execution can slow things down dramatically.

**Recommended Action:**

Increase `work_mem` until the hashing can be performed in a single batch.
