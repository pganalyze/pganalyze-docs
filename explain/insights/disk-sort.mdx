**Description:**

A Sort node consumes all rows from its child node and produces sorted output. To stay within bounds of `work_mem`, it may need to “spill” the sort operation to disk. This ensures it can continue, but, writing to disk during query execution can slow things down dramatically.

**Recommended Action:**

Increase `work_mem` until the sort can be performed in memory.
