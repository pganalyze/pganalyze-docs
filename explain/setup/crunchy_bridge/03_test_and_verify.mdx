import { CollectorStartCommand } from "../../../install/crunchy_bridge/01_deploy_the_collector.mdx";

import VerifyExplainPublic from '../_verify_explain_public.mdx'

At this point, your pganalyze setup should be ready to collect EXPLAIN plans. Since
you may not have any slow queries in your system right now, we can generate a
synthetic slow query that we can use to confirm everything is working.

The collector includes a flag to do this for you automatically, based on your
`log_min_duration_statement` value.

First, make sure you have configured `log_min_duration_statement`, if you have not already:

```
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = '1s';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

Then run the test explain command:

<CollectorStartCommand apiKey={props.apiKey} logExplain={true} cmd="test-explain" />

This will run an artificially slow query using the Postgres `pg_sleep` function. It
will produce output similar to the following:

```
                      run_container
