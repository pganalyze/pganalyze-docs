In order for the changes to `shared_preload_libraries` to be applied, your database
must be restarted. The command to restart Postgres will depend on the platform you're
running on (and you may need to run as root or use sudo if available):

<InitServiceRestartInstructions service="postgresql" />

After the reboot completes, verify that `shared_preload_libraries` now includes `auto_explain`
and that the setting change does not require a restart (`pending_restart` should be `f`):

```sql
SELECT setting, pending_restart FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'shared_preload_libraries';
```

If `auto_explain` is present, continue to Step 4:
