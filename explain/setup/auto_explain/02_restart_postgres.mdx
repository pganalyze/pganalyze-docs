Postgres must be restarted for the `shared_preload_libraries` changes to take effect. If you are not ready to restart
your database, return to Step 1 and run `ALTER SYSTEM` to restore your `shared_preload_libraries` setting to its
previous value before abandoning setup.

The command to restart Postgres will vary based on your environment (you will need to run the command as root or use sudo):

 * on systemd-based systems: systemctl restart postgresql
 * on upstart-based systems: restart postgresql
 * on sysvinit-based systems: service postgresql restart

(If you're not sure what type of system you're running on, you are most likely using systemd.)

Once Postgres restarts, verify that the change took effect:

```
SHOW shared_preload_libraries;
```

This output should now include `auto_explain`.
