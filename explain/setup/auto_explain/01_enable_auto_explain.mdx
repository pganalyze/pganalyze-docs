First, connect to your database as a Postgres superuser, and ensure the `auto_explain`
module is available.

```
LOAD 'auto_explain';
```

The only expected output is an echo of the "LOAD" command. Then, check the `shared_preload_libraries` setting:

```
SHOW shared_preload_libraries;
```

If it already includes `auto_explain`, you can proceed to [Step 3](03_configure_auto_explain). If not, note that
**you will need to restart Postgres to enable auto_explain**. If you are not ready to do that, stop before making
any configuration changes.

The `shared_preload_libraries` setting should include `pg_stat_statements` and may include other libraries.
Append `auto_explain` to the end of the list and run a statement like the following:

```
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = pg_stat_statements, auto_explain;
```

Make sure you include all your existing `shared_preload_libraries` in the new list or you may disable some critical
functionality.
