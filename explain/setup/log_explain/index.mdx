The log-based EXPLAIN mechanism is an alternative to the `auto_explain` module for EXPLAIN plan collection.
We generally recommend using [auto_explain](/docs/explain/setup/auto_explain) to collect EXPLAIN plans
automatically, but not all environments support the `auto_explain` module (bundled with Postgres), so we
offer an alternative mechanism.

## How log-based EXPLAIN works

This method relies on Postgres logging slow queries, based on the `log_min_duration_statement` setting.

For example, when we have configured `log_min_duration_statement = 1000`, we will get output like the following
for all queries slower than 1,000 ms:

```
LOG: duration: 3205.800 ms execute a2: SELECT "servers".* FROM "servers" WHERE "servers"."id" = 1 LIMIT 2
```

When the pganalyze collector sees these events, it runs EXPLAIN automatically, so you get the EXPLAIN plan for
each slow query, together with the log event.

Note that log-based EXPLAIN method has the following limitations:

* The collector only runs EXPLAIN, not EXPLAIN ANALYZE (to avoid any performance impact)
  * execution metrics, such as I/O time and Buffer counts are not captured
* The pganalyze monitoring user needs to have sufficient permissions to run EXPLAIN on the query
* Plans may sometimes be different from the executed plans (e.g., due to session-specific configuration settings)
* Plans for some queries may not be obtainable (e.g., due to use of temporary tables or `search_path` differences)

In spite of this, we find log-based Automated EXPLAIN provides valuable insights into database performance.
