We generally recommend using [auto_explain](/docs/explain/setup/auto_explain) to collect EXPLAIN plans automatically.

However, not all environments support the `auto_explain` extension (bundled with Postgres), and therefore we support an alternative mechanism.

## How Log-based EXPLAIN works


## Pre-requisites

* You have a working [Log Insights integration](/docs/log-insights) that is showing data in the pganalyze UI

## Setup steps

 * [Step 1: Enabling log-based EXPLAIN](/docs/explain/setup/log_explain/01_enable_log_based_explain)
 * [Step 2: Create helper functions](/docs/explain/setup/log_explain/02_create_helper_functions)
 * [Step 3: Testing the configuration](/docs/explain/setup/log_explain/03_testing_the_configuration)
