At this point, your pganalyze setup should be ready to collect EXPLAIN plans. Since
you may not have any slow queries in your system right now, we can generate a
synthetic slow query that we can use to confirm everything is working.

The Postgres `pg_sleep` function, which just waits for the specified number of seconds,
is perfect for this. Check your current `log_min_duration_statement`:

```sql
SHOW 'log_min_duration_statement';
```

And then run a `pg_sleep` with a value just over this (remember, the `log_min_duration_statement`
value will be shown in milliseconds, but `pg_sleep` takes an argument in seconds). E.g.,
if your `log_min_duration_statement` is 1000ms, you can run

```sql
SELECT pg_sleep(1.1)
```

  After a few minutes, you should be able to see the plan for this query on the EXPLAIN Plans page.
