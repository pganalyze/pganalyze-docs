Enabling log-based EXPLAIN only requires adding the following configuration setting to your collector:

```
enable_log_explain: true
```

When using the Docker container, instead use `PGA_ENABLE_LOG_EXPLAIN=true` as an environment variable setting.

Afterwards make sure to reload the pganalyze collector, so the setting takes effect:

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --test --reload
```

If this test succeeds, continue to the next step to test plan collection:
