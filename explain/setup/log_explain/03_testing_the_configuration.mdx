To test the configuration, we recommend running a `pg_sleep` statement that exceeds the `log_min_duration_statement` threshold:

```
SELECT pg_sleep(5);
```

Assuming the collector is running in the background, after a few minutes you should then see an EXPLAIN plan show up in the pganalyze EXPLAIN plan list:

<img src={imgLogExplainOverview} alt="Screenshot of EXPLAIN list in pganalyze" />

When you go to the details, you will find the corresponding plan:

<img src={imgLogExplainDetails} alt="Screenshot of EXPLAIN plan in pganalyze" />

From now on, you will now get EXPLAIN plans automatically in the pganalyze UI, for all your slow queries.
