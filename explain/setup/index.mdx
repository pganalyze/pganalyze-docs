EXPLAIN plans are essential to understanding why exactly a query is slow. SQL is a declarative language,
but to get query results, the Postgres executor performs a series of steps determined by the query planner.
The EXPLAIN command gives you access to those query plans, allowing you to diagnose and optimize performance
problems. The pganalyze Automated EXPLAIN feature gives you easy access to these query plans, and adds
EXPLAIN insights to help you interpret the raw plan information.


### Pre-requisites

* Automatic explain plan collection requires [Log Insights](/docs/log-insights) to be set up successfully


### Overview

pganalyze supports two different mechanisms for collecting EXPLAIN plans automatically:

* **[auto_explain](/docs/explain/setup/auto_explain)**<br />Postgres collects EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN ANALYZE) data as part of query processing, based on `auto_explain.log_min_duration`, reflecting the actual plan that was used
* **[Log-based EXPLAIN](/docs/explain/setup/log_explain)**<br />pganalyze collector runs EXPLAIN (without ANALYZE) on all queries logged based on `log_min_duration_statement`, after the query has completed

Generally we recommend utilizing **auto_explain** where available, as it provides higher data quality.

Log-based EXPLAIN is not guaranteed to show the same plan that was executed, and cannot show execution metrics like I/O timing or buffer usage.
