import VerifyExplainPublic from '../_verify_explain_public.mdx'

At this point, your pganalyze setup should be ready to collect EXPLAIN plans. Since
you may not have any slow queries in your system right now, we can generate a
synthetic slow query that we can use to confirm everything is working.

The collector includes a flag to do this for you automatically, based on your
`auto_explain.log_min_duration`:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`heroku run -a [your-collector-app-name] -- collector --test-explain
`}
</CodeBlock>

This will run an artificially slow query using the Postgres `pg_sleep` function. It
will produce output similar to the following:

<CodeBlock language="text">
{`Running collector --test-explain on â¬¢ [your-collector-app-name]... up, run.3163
2024/09/23 09:30:19 I Running collector test with pganalyze-collector 0.58.0
2024/09/23 09:30:19 I [DATABASE_URL] Emitted test explain; check pganalyze EXPLAIN Plans page for result
`}
</CodeBlock>
