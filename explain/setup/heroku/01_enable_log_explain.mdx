We generally recommend using [auto_explain](https://pganalyze.com/docs/explain/setup/auto_explain) to collect
EXPLAIN plans automatically, but Heroku does not support the required `auto_explain` module, so we offer an
alternative, log-based, EXPLAIN mechanism.

The log-based EXPLAIN mechanism works by watching your logs for slow queries (according to `log_min_duration_statement`)
and running EXPLAIN for each one. This has some limitations (most notably, we only run EXPLAIN, not EXPLAIN ANALYZE), but still
provides valuable insights. Learn more in our [Log-based EXPLAIN overview](https://pganalyze.com/docs/explain/setup/log_explain).

Once Log Insights is working, enabling EXPLAIN plan collection just requires turning on the collector setting. You
can do this by setting a config var on your Heroku app:

```
$ heroku config:set PGA_ENABLE_LOG_EXPLAIN=true -a [your-collector-app-name]
```

This will show output like the following:

```
Setting PGA_ENABLE_LOG_EXPLAIN and restarting â¬¢ [your-collector-app-name]... done, v42
PGA_ENABLE_LOG_EXPLAIN: true
```
