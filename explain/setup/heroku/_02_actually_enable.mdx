You can enable `auto_explain` for your Heroku Postgres by running the following:

```sh
$ heroku pg:settings:auto-explain on -a [your-app-name]
```

Subsequent Postgres sessions will then be configured with those settings and
will automatically log the EXPLAIN plan for any qualifying statements to your Postgres logs.

Before proceeding to the next step, start a new Postgres session to load the
`auto_explain` module.

```sh
$ heroku pg:psql -a [your-app-name]
```
