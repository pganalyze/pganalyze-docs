You can enable `auto_explain` for your Heroku Postgres by running the following:

```sh
heroku pg:settings:auto-explain on -a [your-app-name]
```

Subsequent Postgres sessions will then be configured with those settings and
will automatically log the EXPLAIN plan for any qualifying statements to your Postgres logs.
