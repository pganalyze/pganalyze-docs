import VerifyExplainPublic from '../_verify_explain_public.mdx'

At this point, your pganalyze setup should be ready to collect EXPLAIN plans. Since
you may not have any slow queries in your system right now, we can generate a
synthetic slow query that we can use to confirm everything is working.

The collector includes a flag to do this for you automatically, based on your
`auto_explain.log_min_duration`:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`sudo pganalyze-collector --test-explain
`}
</CodeBlock>

This will produce no output but will run an artificially slow query using the
Postgres `pg_sleep` function.
