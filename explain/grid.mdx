The pganalyze EXPLAIN grid view is an alternate way to inspect query plans. It's
more compact, and modeled after the native Postgres text EXPLAIN format, but
includes some quality of life improvements.

Note that this view is a work in progress, and may not include all the plan
information you're interested in yet. In that case, check the Node Tree EXPLAIN
view or the source of individual nodes (and please [contact us with
feedback](mailto:support@pganalyze.com)).

## Plan layout

The query plan is displayed in a way similar to the Postgres text EXPLAIN format,
but with some important differences:

 - Common Table Expressions (WITH clause entries) and any other independent
   subqueries are broken out into their own section.
 - The focus is on the shape of the plan and node details are available only
   after clicking to select a specific node.
 - Scan details include the table being scanned, the index used (if any), and
   the alias used for this table reference in the query (if any).


## Metrics

The execution metric to show can be selected at the top of the plan:

  - **Est. Cost**: The cost of the node according to the Postgres planning model,
    excluding the cost of the node's children.
  - **Runtime**: How much time was spent executing this node, excluding time spent
    executing the node's children.
  - **Rows**: How many rows each node produced, and how many it was expected to
    produce according to the query plan.
  - **Buffers**: How many buffers were hit in the buffer cache and read from disk
    (these are combined) or dirtied while executing this query, excluding
    buffers touched while executing the node's children.
  - **Reads**: How much data was read from disk (or the OS page cache) and how much
    time was spent reading it.
  - **Writes**: How much data was written to disk and how much time was spent
    writing it.

Learn more about these in our [plan comparison
documentation](/docs/explain/plan-comparison). Note that not all execution
metrics may be available, depending on your Postgres settings.

### Loops

Sometimes, a plan node is executed repeatedly, usually due to a nested loop join
above it. These nodes are flagged with a repeat icon. Note that a whole subtree
may loop. When a node is looped, metrics are reported as a total over all loops.


### Parallelism

If parallelism is involved, metrics other than Runtime are summed over all
workers. Runtime is represented as the Runtime of the slowest worker (this is
generally a more useful metric).


### Buffers

Note that Buffers are counted per-access, not uniquely, so they may be
overcounted when loops are involved. Buffers counts omit temp blocks, which are
typically used for sorts and other similar operations that spill to disk.


### Reads and Writes

Both these metrics omit temp blocks, which are typically used for sorts and
other similar operations that spill to disk. Temp tables and other temporary
objects are still counted (they use local blocks).
