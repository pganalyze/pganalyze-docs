**Description:**

Scan a table when the [TABLESAMPLE](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/tablesample-in-postgresql-9-5-2/) feature is used. Note that this clause does change the semantics of your query, but if youâ€™re looking to gather some statistics about data in a large table, it can be a lot more efficient than a full sequential scan.
