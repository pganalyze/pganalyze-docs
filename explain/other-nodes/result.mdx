**Description:**

If no outer plan, evaluate a variable-free targetlist. If outer plan, return tuples from outer plan (after a level of projection as shown by targetlist). If resconstantqual isn't NULL, it represents a one-time qualification test (i.e., one that doesn't depend on any variables from the outer plan, so needs to be evaluated only once).
