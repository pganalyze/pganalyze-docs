**Description:**

Joins two children already sorted by their shared join key. This only needs to scan each relation once, but both inputs need to be sorted by the join key first (or scanned in a way that produces already-sorted output, like an index scan matching the required sort order).

**Important Fields:**

- Filter
- Inner Unique
- Join Filter
- Join Type
- Merge Cond
- Rows Removed by Filter
- Rows Removed by Join Filter
