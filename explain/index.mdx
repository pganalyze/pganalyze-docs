## The Basics

First time looking at **EXPLAIN**, or trying to understand how query plans work?

Start here: **[The Basics of Postgres Query Planning](/docs/explain/basics-of-postgres-query-planning)**

## Postgres Plan Nodes

Understanding the behavior and performance of individual plan nodes (and when Postgres chooses them for a plan) is critical to understanding overall query planning.

Node types can be broadly considered in three categories:

* [Scan nodes](/docs/explain/scan-nodes): Produce rows from underlying table data
* [Join nodes](/docs/explain/join-nodes): Combine rows from child nodes
* [Other nodes](/docs/explain/other-nodes): Broad variety of functionality (e.g. aggregation, limiting, grouping, etc)

## Query Plan Visualization

pganalyze includes built-in visualization of query plans, automatically collected from the Postgres logs:

<a href="/postgres-explain">
  <ImgVisualization />
</a>
<br />

It also includes an alternate grid-based visualization:

<a href="/docs/explain/grid">
  <ImgGrid />
</a>
<br />

This includes an interface for [comparing different plans](/docs/explain/plan-comparison) for the same query.

## Set up automatic EXPLAIN plan collection

Learn how to **[enable automatic EXPLAIN plan collection](/docs/explain/setup)**.

## pganalyze EXPLAIN Insights

Wondering how you should optimize a particular query?

pganalyze automatically analyzes EXPLAIN plans to find the most important insights:

* **[Disk Sort](/docs/explain/insights/disk-sort)**<br />When a Sort operation spills to disk due to low work_mem settings
* **[Hash Batches](/docs/explain/insights/hash-batches)**<br />When a Hash operation spills to disk due to low work_mem settings
* **[Inefficient Index](/docs/explain/insights/inefficient-index)**<br />When an index is inefficient because it's loading too much data and then filters rows without an index
* **[Large Offset](/docs/explain/insights/large-offset)**<br />When OFFSET is used for pagination, instead of an efficient method such as keyset-based pagination
* **[Lossy Bitmaps](/docs/explain/insights/lossy-bitmaps)**<br />Bitmap Heap Scan that utilizes a lossy bitmap due to low work_mem 
* **[Mis-Estimate](/docs/explain/insights/mis-estimate)**<br />The Postgres planner mis-estimated the number of rows a particular plan node returns
* **[Slow Scan](/docs/explain/insights/slow-scan)**<br />Sequential Scan that removed a significant number of rows (an index would have helped to avoid this)
* **[Stale Stats](/docs/explain/insights/stale-stats)**<br />The table referenced has not had an `ANALYZE` run recently (potentially leading to inefficient plans)
