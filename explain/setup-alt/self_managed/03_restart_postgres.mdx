In order for the changes to `shared_preload_libraries` to be applied, your database
must be restarted. The command to restart Postgres will depend on the platform you're
running on (and you may need to run as root or use sudo if available):

 * on systemd-based systems: systemctl restart postgresql
 * on upstart-based systems: restart postgresql
 * on sysvinit-based systems: service postgresql restart

(If you're not sure what type of system you're running on, you are most likely using systemd.)

After the reboot completes, continue to Step 4:
