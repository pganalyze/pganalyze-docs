A restart will be required to enable the `auto_explain` functionality.
If a restart is not acceptable for this server right now, you can instead try our alternate
[log-based EXPLAIN mechanism](/somewhere). You can switch to the `auto_explain` mechanism
at any time in the future by turning off the `enable_log_explain` collector setting and
following the `auto_explain` setup instructions here.
