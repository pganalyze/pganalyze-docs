To uninstall pganalyze from your system, follow these two steps:

1. [Cleaning up a monitoring user and helper functions](#cleaning-up-a-monitoring-user-and-helper-functions)
2. [Uninstalling the collector](#uninstalling-the-collector)

## Cleaning up a monitoring user and helper functions

To uninstall the pganalyze collector, first you'll need to clean up a pganalyze
monitoring user and helper functions that you created during the setup.

* Run `DROP SCHEMA pganalyze CASCADE` in each database that you monitor to
  remove helper functions
* Run `DROP USER pganalyze` in any database to remove a monitoring user


## Uninstalling the collector

Since there are many different ways to run the collector, the uninstall process
will depend on how you originally set up the collector:

 - [RPM package deployment](#rpm-package-deployment) (for Amazon Linux 2, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora VMs)
 - [Debian and Ubuntu package deployment](#debian-and-ubuntu-package-deployment) (for Debian and Ubuntu VMs)
 - [Container deployment](#container-deployment) (for Docker, ECS and other container runtimes)
 - [Heroku deployment](#heroku-deployment)

### RPM package deployment

On Amazon Linux 2, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other systems using RPM packages,
you can uninstall the collector through the standard uninstall mechanism.

First, remove the collector package from your system (this includes disabling
and stopping the service):
```
sudo yum remove pganalyze-collector
```

Then, clean up a state file and its directory:
```
sudo rm -r /var/lib/pganalyze-collector
```

Finally, clean up the user and group:
```
sudo userdel pganalyze # this will delete the group too
```

### Debian and Ubuntu package deployment

On systems using Debian-based packages, you can uninstall the collector through
the standard uninstall mechanism.

First, remove the collector package from your system (this includes disabling
and stopping the service):
```
sudo apt remove pganalyze-collector
```

Then, clean up a state file and its directory:
```
sudo rm -r /var/lib/pganalyze-collector
```

Finally, clean up the user and group:
```
sudo userdel pganalyze # this will delete the group too
```

### Container deployment

On Amazon ECS, Google Cloud Run, or other Docker environments, you simply need
to tear down the container.
If you created any additional things for monitoring, such as an IAM policy and
role for Amazon RDS and Aurora instances, delete them too.

### Heroku deployment

To uninstall the pganalyze collector on Heroku, you simply need to delete the
collector application.
