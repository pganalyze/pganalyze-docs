You can set up the pganalyze collector OpenTelemetry exporter with New Relic so
that you can have a span for the EXPLAIN plan inside of the trace of your
application, such as a web request trace.
The span contains the link to the EXPLAIN plan in the pganalyze app, so that you
can easily visit the pganalyze page to find out why the query is slow.

New Relic provides OTLP endpoints that you can use to export tracing spans from
the pganalyze collector. In your application side, you can either use the
New Relic agent or OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs.

## Setup steps

1. [Start sending data of your application to New Relic](#start-sending-data-of-your-application-to-new-relic)
2. [Add traceparent query tag to the query](#add-traceparent-query-tag-to-the-query)
3. [Create a New Relic API key](#create-a-new-relic-api-key)
4. [Setup an API key and an endpoint in the pganalyze collector](#setup-an-api-key-and-an-endpoint-in-the-pganalyze-collector)

### Start sending data of your application to New Relic

To start sending data of your application to New Relic, you can either use the
guided install and install the New Relic agent, or use OpenTelemetry APIs and
SDKs. You can read how to setup OpenTelemetry integration in [their documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-set-up-your-app/).

Using New Relic agents If you choose to use the New Relic agent, make sure to use the version that
supports [Distributed Tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing/).
Latest version of agents in each language support it and also it's enabled by
default.

### Add traceparent query tag to the query

When you use OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs to send data to New Relic, you can
follow the [traceparent documentation](/docs/collector/otel-setup/traceparent)
to add a traceparent query tag to the query.

When you are using the New Relic agent, you'll need to modify how to generate a
traceparent value. You can still follow the traceparent documentation for how to
add it as a query tag, then you can generate a traceparent tag like the
following ways.

#### Ruby

```ruby
# make sure NewRelic::Agent::Transaction.tl_current is present
# before generating a traceparent
current_trace = NewRelic::Agent::Transaction.tl_current

format(
  '00-%<trace_id>s-%<parent_id>s-%<trace_flags>.2d',
  trace_id: current_trace.trace_id.rjust(32, '0').downcase,
  parent_id: current_trace.current_segment.guid,
  trace_flags: current_trace.sampled? ? '01' : '00'
)
```

#### Python

```python
import newrelic.agent


dummy_headers = []
newrelic.agent.insert_distributed_trace_headers(dummy_headers)
traceparent = None

for key, value in dummy_headers:
    if key == 'traceparent':
        traceparent = value
        break

# only add traceparent as a query tag when it's not None
```

For Go, it is the best to use OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs as it will integrate
well with sqlcommenter and the traceparent query tag will be added without any
extra setups.

### Create a New Relic API key

You can create a new API key with a ["License" key type](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/).
You can optionally use the same key as the one used by your application.

### Setup an API key and an endpoint in the pganalyze collector

Once you obtain an API key, update the following collector settings to start
sending out tracing spans to New Relic:

* `otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint` (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`): `https://otlp.nr-data.net`
  * other endpoints and ports are available, see [New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/get-started/opentelemetry-set-up-your-app/) for the detail to pick the best one for your application
* `otel_exporter_otlp_headers` (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`): `api-key=<API key from the previous step>`

Optionally, you can also set `otel_service_name` (`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`) to update
the service name reported to New Relic from the pganalyze collector.

Make sure to restart the collector after updating the settings.
