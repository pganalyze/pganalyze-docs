Pre-built collector packages are available on common Debian-based and Red Hat-based Linux
distributions for x86 and ARM architectures. Support for BSD-based platforms, or other
architectures is available by building [from source](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector).

We recommend running our install script to automatically detect your platform and
install the correct package:

```
curl https://packages.pganalyze.com/collector-install.sh | bash
```

Alternately, you can install these packages manually.

These repositories are updated by pganalyze whenever a new stable version of the
collector is released.

You can also build the collector [from source](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector): Go 1.20 and
`make` are required. To build, just run `make`.
