The collector is available on common Debian-based and Red Hat-based Linux distributions.
We recommend running our install script to automatically detect your platform and
install the correct package:

```
curl https://packages.pganalyze.com/collector-install.sh | bash
```

Alternately, you can install these packages manually.

<CollectorPkgInstallInstructions />

These repositories are updated by pganalyze whenever a new stable version of the
collector is released.

You can also build the collector from source: Go 1.16 and `make` are required. To build,
just run `make`.
