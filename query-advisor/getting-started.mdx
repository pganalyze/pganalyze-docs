Query Advisor automatically analyzes Postgres query execution plans to detect optimization opportunities. This guide covers the requirements and setup needed to start using Query Advisor effectively.

## What you get with Query Advisor

Query Advisor provides **continuous, automated query optimization insights** for your Postgres databases:

- **Automated analysis**: Continuously examines EXPLAIN plans to identify performance anti-patterns
- **Single query focus**: Optimizes individual queries through rewrites and planner hints, complementing Index Advisor's schema-level recommendations
- **Deterministic approach**: Uses purpose-built algorithms based on Postgres planner behavior with no AI hallucinations
- **Workbooks integration**: Seamlessly integrates with pganalyze Workbooks for systematic testing and benchmarking
- **Confidence building**: Provides suggested parameter sets and systematic validation workflows

Query Advisor identifies the optimization opportunities - you maintain control over applying changes to production.

## Supported optimization insights

Query Advisor currently detects and provides solutions for these common Postgres performance issues:

### Inefficient Nested Loops
Detects when Postgres chooses nested loop joins due to row estimation mismatches, suggesting hash or merge join alternatives through query rewrites.

### Wrong Index Due To ORDER BY
Identifies queries where Postgres uses an index only for sorting while filtering large numbers of rows, suggesting modifications to force better index utilization.

More optimization patterns are continuously being added. See the complete list in [Supported Insights](/docs/query-advisor/insights).

## Collector requirements

Query Advisor requires the pganalyze collector to be properly configured for query monitoring:

### Basic Requirements
- **pganalyze collector** installed and running
- **pg_stat_statements** enabled for query statistics collection
- **Database connectivity** for the collector to access query metadata

### EXPLAIN Plan Collection
Query Advisor analyzes Postgres EXPLAIN plans, which can be collected through:

**Automated collection (recommended):**
- **auto_explain** extension enabled
- **log_analyze** parameter enabled for row count accuracy

**Manual collection:**
- EXPLAIN plans uploaded directly through pganalyze Workbooks
- On-demand analysis when creating new workbooks

### Enhanced Experience
For the best Query Advisor experience:
- Enable the collector workflow for seamless workbook testing
- Configure auto_explain with appropriate thresholds to capture slow queries
- Enable log_analyze to provide accurate row count data for misestimation detection

## Set up auto_explain for continuous monitoring

To enable continuous Query Advisor analysis, configure Postgres's auto_explain extension:

### Platform-specific auto_explain setup

The auto_explain configuration process varies by Postgres hosting platform:

- **Amazon RDS/Aurora**: [Configure auto_explain via parameter groups](/docs/explain/setup/amazon_rds)
- **Google Cloud SQL**: [Enable auto_explain through database flags](/docs/explain/setup/google_cloud_sql)
- **Azure Database**: [Configure auto_explain via server parameters](/docs/explain/setup/azure_database)
- **Self-managed**: [Manual auto_explain configuration](/docs/explain/setup/self_managed)

Refer to the [EXPLAIN setup guides](/docs/explain/setup) for detailed platform-specific instructions.

## Enable log_analyze for accurate insights

The `log_analyze` parameter is crucial for Query Advisor's misestimation detection:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`-- Enable row count collection in auto_explain
SET auto_explain.log_analyze = on;`}
</CodeBlock>

This setting ensures that EXPLAIN ANALYZE data includes actual row counts, enabling Query Advisor to detect when Postgres's row estimates differ significantly from reality - a key indicator of optimization opportunities.

## Where to find Query Advisor

Once configured, Query Advisor insights appear in several locations:

### Query Advisor Landing Page
Access the dedicated Query Advisor section to view all detected optimization opportunities across your databases, organized by potential impact.

### Automated EXPLAIN Collection
As pganalyze collects EXPLAIN plans through auto_explain, Query Advisor automatically analyzes them and flags problematic patterns in near real-time.

### Workbooks Integration
When creating workbooks or analyzing queries, Query Advisor automatically assesses plans and provides optimization suggestions you can apply directly in the workbook editor.

### Query Detail Views
Individual query performance pages display Query Advisor insights alongside other metrics, providing context-aware optimization recommendations.

## Verification and testing

Query Advisor integrates with pganalyze Workbooks to provide a systematic approach to testing optimizations:

1. **Baseline recording**: Capture current query performance as a baseline
2. **Apply insights**: Use Query Advisor's suggested rewrites to create variants
3. **Benchmark results**: Compare performance improvements systematically
4. **Validate changes**: Ensure optimizations work across different parameter sets
5. **Apply to production**: Implement verified improvements with confidence

This workflow ensures that all optimizations are tested and validated before production deployment.
