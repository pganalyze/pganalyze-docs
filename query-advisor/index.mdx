pganalyze Query Advisor automatically analyzes PostgreSQL query execution plans to identify optimization opportunities and provides actionable suggestions for improving query performance. Unlike traditional query optimization approaches, Query Advisor operates continuously in the background, detecting common PostgreSQL planner issues and offering deterministic, tested solutions.

## What Query Advisor provides

Query Advisor focuses on **single query optimization** through systematic analysis of EXPLAIN plans. Key capabilities include:

- **Automated pattern detection**: Continuously analyzes query plans to identify known PostgreSQL performance anti-patterns
- **Deterministic insights**: Uses purpose-built algorithms based on PostgreSQL planner behavior - no AI hallucinations
- **Actionable rewrites**: Provides tested query modifications that resolve detected issues
- **Workbook integration**: Seamlessly works with [pganalyze Workbooks](/docs/workbooks) for benchmarking and validation
- **Confidence building**: Suggests parameter sets and provides systematic testing workflows

Query Advisor detects issues automatically and provides the insights - you apply the changes based on verified performance improvements.

## Where to find Query Advisor

Query Advisor insights appear in multiple locations throughout pganalyze:

### Query Advisor Landing Page
The dedicated Query Advisor section shows all automatically detected issues across your databases, organized by severity and potential impact.

### Workbooks Integration
When creating new workbooks or analyzing existing queries, Query Advisor automatically assesses plans and suggests optimizations. You can apply suggested rewrites directly in the workbook editor.

### Query Detail Views
Individual query pages display Query Advisor insights alongside other performance metrics, providing context-aware optimization suggestions.

### Automated EXPLAIN Collection
As pganalyze collects EXPLAIN plans through auto_explain, Query Advisor continuously evaluates them for optimization opportunities in real-time.

## Common optimization patterns

Query Advisor currently detects and provides solutions for these PostgreSQL performance issues:

- **Inefficient Nested Loops**: Identifies row estimation mismatches that cause PostgreSQL to choose nested loops instead of more efficient hash or merge joins
- **ORDER BY + LIMIT Index Problems**: Detects when PostgreSQL uses an index only for sorting while filtering large numbers of rows, suggesting better index usage patterns

Additional optimization patterns are continuously being added based on real-world PostgreSQL performance issues.

## Requirements

To use Query Advisor effectively:

- **PostgreSQL monitoring**: pganalyze collector must be installed and collecting query statistics
- **EXPLAIN plan collection**: Either auto_explain enabled or manual EXPLAIN uploads via workbooks
- **Best experience**: [Enable the collector workflow](/docs/workbooks/collector-workflow) for seamless testing and verification

Query Advisor works with both automated collection (continuous monitoring) and on-demand analysis (workbook-based testing).
