pganalyze Query Advisor automatically analyzes Postgres query execution plans to identify optimization opportunities and provides actionable suggestions for improving query performance. Unlike traditional query optimization approaches, Query Advisor operates continuously in the background, detecting common Postgres planner issues and offering deterministic, tested solutions.

## What Query Advisor provides

Query Advisor focuses on **single query optimization** through systematic analysis of EXPLAIN plans. Key capabilities include:

- **Automated pattern detection**: Continuously analyzes query plans to identify known Postgres performance anti-patterns
- **Deterministic insights**: Uses purpose-built algorithms based on Postgres planner behavior
- **Actionable rewrites**: Provides tested query modifications that resolve detected issues
- **Workbook integration**: Seamlessly works with [pganalyze Workbooks](/docs/workbooks) for benchmarking and validation
- **Confidence building**: Suggests parameter sets and provides systematic testing workflows

Query Advisor detects issues automatically and provides the insights - you apply the changes based on verified performance improvements.
