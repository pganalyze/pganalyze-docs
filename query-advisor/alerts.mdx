Query Advisor automatically detects optimization opportunities, but you need to configure alerts to get notified when new insights are discovered. This guide covers setting up alerts for Query Advisor insights and integrating with your notification workflows.

## Alert configuration overview

Query Advisor checks are **enabled by default** for all databases in your pganalyze organization, but **alerts must be explicitly configured** through alert policies to receive notifications about newly detected optimization opportunities.

### Default behavior
- **Continuous monitoring**: Query Advisor analyzes all incoming EXPLAIN plans automatically
- **Background detection**: Insights are generated and stored without notifications
- **Dashboard visibility**: All insights appear on the Query Advisor landing page
- **No notifications**: You won't receive alerts until explicitly configured

### Alert activation
To receive notifications about Query Advisor insights:
1. **Create or modify alert policies** to include Query Advisor checks
2. **Configure notification channels** (email, Slack)

## Troubleshooting alerts

### No alerts despite slow queries
- **Check auto_explain configuration**: Ensure EXPLAIN plans are being collected
- **Verify alert policy**: Confirm Query Advisor checks are enabled
