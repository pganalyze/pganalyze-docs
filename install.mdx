  <p>If you're interested in integrating pganalyze with your database hosting provider but don't see it listed as officially supported, you can follow the <a href="/docs/install/self_managed/00_choose_setup_method">installation guide for self-managed databases</a>. You will need to run the pganalyze collector on a server that can reach your database in order to connect it to your provider. Note that <a href="/docs/log-insights">Log Insights</a> and other features that depend on it will have some limitations.</p>
