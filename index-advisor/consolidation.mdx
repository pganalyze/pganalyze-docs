The pganalyze Index Advisor includes an **experimental, early access** feature
to include index consolidation insights (i.e., insights that use `DROP INDEX`
recommendations in addition to `CREATE INDEX`).


## Overview

While indexes can dramatically speed up many queries, they do have some
performance impact on your database: [write
overhead](/docs/indexing-engine/index-write-overhead), additional memory needed
for the index data structure while in use, and disk space. To optimize the
number of indexes recommended, the Index Advisor considers the full query
workload on a table rather than recommending indexes specifically for each query
or each scan. This works well when starting from scratch, but when starting with
existing indexes, it may lead to over-indexing. Consolidation insights can help.


## Limitations

 - Dropping the wrong index can have a catastrophic impact on database
   performance. We recommend [testing](/docs/index-advisor/test-insights) all
   Index Advisor insights before implementing them, but this is especially true
   of consolidation insights.
 - Index Advisor currently has a limited model of partial indexes (indexes with
   a `WHERE` clause), and will likely recommend dropping them: these insights
   should be ignored, or at least reviewed very critically.
 - Index Advisor generates insights that are intended to be taken as a group:
   e.g., a `DROP INDEX` recommendation may exist because it's supplanted by a
   separate `CREATE INDEX` recommendation. We do not recommend applying `DROP
   INDEX` recommendations independently unless they are carefully reviewed and
   tested.


## Usage

In order to use consolidation insights, first your pganalyze organization must
be flagged into early access (see below).

Once flagged in, go to the Schema Statistics page in the menu, click on the
table you are interested in, and click on the Index Advisor tab. Then, select
"Custom Configuration" and check the "Allow consolidation/removal of
indexes" checkbox:

Click "Try configuration" to see Index Advisor insights with consolidation
enabled. You can then save this
[configuration](/docs/index-advisor/configuration) like any other. Consolidation
is currently only available on a table-by-table basis, only using custom
configurations (though note you can load any of our default configurations as
the starting point).


## Early access

If you are interested in exploring this experimental feature, please [contact
us](/contact). The feature will be enabled for your entire organization, so any
organization member with access to a particular server and database in pganalyze
will be able to use it. Please ensure your colleagues understand the limitations
listed above and do not apply the recommendations without adequate review and
testing.
