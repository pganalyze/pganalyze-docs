Index Advisor checks are enabled by default for all your databases, but alerts
need to be enabled via alert policies. You can also utilize Slack notifications
to notify you of newly detected missing indexes.

Index Advisor supports the following checks:
 - [Missing indexes](/docs/checks/index_advisor/missing_index)
 - [Unused indexes](/docs/checks/schema/index_unused)

You can read more details about the [Alerts & Check-Up system](/docs/checks) in
its own section of the documentation.
