Index Advisor creates issues for newly detected opportunities. They give you
details on the opportunity, the root cause and analysis of data that Index
Advisor does. When reasoning about an index recommendation you want to look at
existing indexes on the table, queries affected, and table scans.


## Affected queries

Affected queries include all queries on a particular table that contain at least
one condition in their WHERE or JOIN clause that would be affected by the index
recommendation, e.g. because an indexed column is also used as a filter
condition in the WHERE clause.


## Scans

On both specific index opportunities, as well as the table and query pages, you
will see the notion of “Scans”. You can learn more about this in the [Behind the
Scenes](/docs/index-advisor/behind-the-scenes#scans) section.

## Existing indexes

To reason about recommendations, the Index Advisor opportunity page also shows
all existing indexes on the table, to make interpretation of the recommendation
easier.
