![With our recommendations we also give you all the context you need to reason about them](/issue-missing-indexes.png)

Index Advisor creates [issues](/docs/checks) for newly detected insights. They
give you details and the context to evaluate the recommendations. When
reasoning about an index recommendation, you may want to refer to existing
indexes on the table, queries affected, and scans on the table.

Different variants of indexes are tried during the Index Advisor recommendation
process that produces the lowest cost (and thus the lowest estimated I/O when
executing the query). When the Index Advisor finds a recommendation, it will show
an expected cost improvement.

## Estimated outcome

</div>

**Scan Cost**

The total and maximum of estimated scan costs across all scans. This is an estimate of I/O effort to
read data, but does not directly translate to query runtime. Lower is better.

**Weighted Cost**

Expected effect of the execution of a scan on the database, based on its cost
and frequency. Like with cost, the absolute value is not meaningful, but can
use relative differences between weighted cost to compare different scans.

**Impact and Weighted Cost Improvement**

This is a weighted average of the estimated cost improvement across all scans
on the table, weighting by average scans / minute. Higher weighted cost
improvements are shown as higher impact.

**Scan Coverage**

The number of scans that are covered by an index out of the total number of scans. Higher is better.

**Indexes Used**

The overall number of indexes on the table, before and after the proposed indexes.

**Index Write Overhead**

The cost of writes to this table by this many bytes for every byte written to the table. Lower is better.

**Update Overhead**

The overhead of each UPDATE statement that is not eligible for the Heap-Only Tuples (HOT) performance
optimization in Postgres due to indexes being present. If possible, this should be kept at 0.

## Index details

![](/issue-missing-indexes-index-detail.png)

If you want to understand what scans and queries are affected by one of the index recommendations,
you can view them on the index detail view. Compare the current costs with the estimated new costs.

## Scan details

![](/issue-missing-indexes-scan-detail.png)

On the scan detail view, you can learn what indexes were considered for any given scan by the
Index Advisor to allow you to debug the costs and selections and understand better why
Index Advisor prefers certain indexes.

The cost for each index is based on the [Postgres query execution cost model](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html).

The weighted cost is weighted by the frequency of the scan (based on the queries that
contain the scan). More frequent queries will have a more significant impact on
the overall weighted cost improvement.

## Scans

![](/scans-list.png)

For recommended indexes, on query detail pages, and schema statistics table
detail pages, you will see a section called “Scans”. Each scan has an associated
estimated cost that is averaged across all queries it is referenced in. For more
information about how this works, [read our Indexing Engine
documentation](/docs/indexing-engine/query-to-scan-breakdown).

On the Index Advisor insight page, the scan list includes the following:
 - Estimated scans per minute
 - The current cost
 - Estimated new cost if you were to apply the recommendation

On the schema statistics table detail pages, the list includes:
 - The scan method
 - The current cost
 - Estimated scans per minute

On the query detail pages, the list includes:
 - The WHERE and JOIN clauses
 - The scan method
 - Index Advisor insight if available
 - The current cost
 - The size of the table being scanned (sequential scans are okay for small tables)

## Affected queries

![](/affected-queries-list.png)

Affected queries include all queries on a particular table that contain at least
one condition in their WHERE or JOIN clause that would be affected by the index
recommendation. E.g., if a column in a proposed index is used as a filter
condition in a WHERE clause, the query may benefit from this index.

By default only queries are shown that will see a cost reduction through the
selected index. You can show all queries that could possibly use the index by
marking the “Show all queries” checkbox.

The scan cost change shows how the estimated cost of the query's scan on the
current table would change when the index is added.

## Existing indexes

Existing indexes on a table are honored by the Index Advisor. To reason about
recommendations, the insight page also shows all existing indexes on the table.
E.g., you may want to avoid adding a proposed index if it's very similar to
an existing index, and instead you may want to rewrite the affected query
so that it can take advantage of the existing index.
