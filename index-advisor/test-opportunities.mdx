We recommend testing recommendations in pre-production or staging environments
first before deploying changes to production. If possible, it is advisable to
use a copy of the production database for your tests, otherwise you may not see
a representative performance improvement or query plan change.

To perform a test and validate whether a recommendation improves performance:

1. Pick one or more of the affected queries mentioned by the Index Advisor
2. Run “EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT …” for each of the queries, twice
3. Note down the runtime of the second invocation (to avoid cold caches
   affecting the test)
4. Additionally, note down the sum of the top level numbers of “shared blocks
   read” and “shared blocks hit” (this represents how much data the query was
   loading)
5. Create the recommended index by copying the “CREATE INDEX” command
6. Re-run the EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) test, and compare the numbers

Note that the Index Advisor cost improvement is an estimate - always test and
verify whether recommendations actually improve performance. In a warm cache
test, as described above, it is likely that the measured improvement for the
query timing is less than expected, as data in cache can be accessed quickly,
even for larger amounts of data.

The “shared buffers read” and “shared buffers hit” counts (combined together)
give you a better measurement of what the true order of magnitude improvement of
a change is, and reflects the cold cache performance better.

You can also use the query statistics and EXPLAIN plans that pganalyze collects
to verify production performance after deploying a change. Index Advisor runs
every 24h, and will resolve a missing index by watching for changes in the
schema. Resolved issues can be viewed by navigating to the Resolved tab on the
Missing Index check page.

Index Advisor is also available from query detail pages. Read more on how that
works in the behind the scenes section.
