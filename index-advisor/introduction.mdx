The pganalyze Index Advisor is a tool to analyze your queries, determine how
Postgres will fetch data from the tables referenced, and suggest indexes to make
those scans more efficient. Index Advisor uses information pganalyze already
collects about your schema and queries in order to provide an analysis for any
table and query. For best results, make sure you are running collector 0.41.2 or
later, and set up the
[get_column_stats](/docs/install/troubleshooting/column_stats_helper) helper
function.

The new version of the Index Advisor considers the whole database when it
creates opportunities. We do not recommend adding indexes to every query as it
influences database performance, especially I/O. Rather, we recommend good
enough indexes that strike the balance between performance and operational
efficiency.

The overall goal of the Index Advisor is to:

 - Optimize for the smallest amount of total I/O required to fulfill the queries
   in the system
 - Supported by a small number of good enough indexes for each table, that have
   as few columns as possible, to keep Index Write Overhead as low as reasonable

View the [Behind the Scenes](/docs/index-advisor/behind-the-scenes) on how Index
Advisor detects opportunities if you want to understand all the details. The Index
Advisor also has some known [limitations](/docs/index-advisor/limitations) that
are important to be conscious of in order to use it effectively.
