## Tools

## Self-check

You can run the following command to check the configuration for basic errors:

```
docker run --env-file ... rake enterprise:self_check
```

This verifies the Postgres, Redis, SMTP and LDAP configuration (if applicable), as well as confirms that the license is active.

### Docker Container Logs

When running Docker on a virtual machine to run pganalyze, you can run the following command:

```
docker logs -f pganalyze
```

This will show the full log messages from the pganalyze app, as well as errors from the collector inside the Enterprise Server container.

If you encounter an error screen in the software this will show the details. This information will be required when submitting issues to our support team.

## Common errors

### Error: License Invalid or Expired

If you see the notice `Error: License Invalid or Expired` when logging into pganalyze,
it means that pganalyze Enterprise Server wasn't able to verify the `LICENSE_KEY` that
is passed.

**Step 1:** Verify that you are passing `LICENSE_KEY` to the Docker container. Your license
key is identical to the download password that is used to download the image. Reach out
to support in case you don't have your license key available.

**Step 2:** Make sure that the pganalyze container is able to send a HTTPS request to port 443 on `enterprise-license-check.pganalyze.com`, which is needed to verify the license key.

**Step 3:** Try restarting the container, and check whether the same error recurs.

If the error is still occurring, please run `rake enterprise:self_check`, which will return more details like this:

```
$ docker run ... quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[version] rake enterprise:self_check

Testing database connection... Success!
Testing Redis connection... Success!
Skipping LDAP test.
