## New features

- Add SSL mode dropdown when adding servers
  - Allows enforcing the SSL certificate for Amazon RDS, amongst others
- Add VACUUM visualization on table detail page
  - This visualizes the dead tuples accumulated compared to the vacuums that have run
    (autovacuum monitoring still requires a manual step to be enabled)
- Show long-running query issues on query page and connection trace page
- Merge Alerts and Check-Up into a more coherent UI, change up navigation
- Show average I/O time in query overview graphs


## Bugfixes

- Prevent realtime checks from being resolved by regular check-up
- Use fetch polyfill everywhere (for now)


## Performance Improvements

- Disable `backend_states.seen_at_range` - its too expensive to update
- Only show up to 25 queries on backend details page
- Use react router to make switching between list and details fast
- Refactor all legacy data tables into new virtualized tables
- Add missing index on `query_overview_stats`
