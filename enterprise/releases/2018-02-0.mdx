**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2018.02.0`

## New features

- Mobile friendly layout
  - pganalyze is now usable on mobile web - although not all views work well on
    small screens, this allows you to navigate around and see current database
    issues
- Secondary navigation on detail pages
  - Detail pages for queries, tables and other objects have been redone
- Allow overriding the default organization for LDAP signups
  - You can now specify the `DEFAULT_ORG_NAME` environment variable to automatically
    assign new LDAP sign-ins to a specific organization (alternatively the first organization is chosen)
- Add "Query Origins" data collection
  - Query origins are annotations on the query using SQL comments, like this: `/* controller:pages */ SELECT 1`,
    which will then show up on the query details page in a grouped form
  - You can use existing tooling such as [marginalia](https://github.com/basecamp/marginalia)
    for Rails to automatically annotate queries
- Add `DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable
  - Set this to the hostname of your pganalyze installation, in order for alert
    emails and other links that include the hostname to be correct
- Add Queries tab on table details
  - This shows all queries that reference a particular table on the table details page
- Add "Usage Statistics" section to organization settings
- Allow self-serve creation of read-only API keys
- Stop hiding truncated and unidentified queries from the overview
  - This is a behavior change from previously, and is intended to show you
    truncated queries (i.e. queries whose text was too long to be stored) in
    order to gauge whether they represent a substantial part of your workload
- Log Insights improvements
  - Additional classifications for log events
  - Add Log Analysis for Temp File Created log events
  - Add Log Analysis for "Checkpoint Starting" log event
  - Always show server-wide log lines on database-specific Log Insights page
  - Store log event details as JSONB
- Show system data for Heroku Postgres, show 90/100% limit for I/O utilization
- Add Cache Hit Ratio graph to query detail page
- Replication check: Don't fail for servers that had no snapshots yet


## Bugfixes

- Normalize multi-row VALUES lists better
- Polyfill Promise and Array#forEach to fix IE11 support
- Vacuum overview/details: Allow table to be null
- Fix per-query sample count and log line count with multiple fingerprints
- Fix bug that makes system tab crash when system_info.data is null
- Fix display bug for Heroku Postgres databases on System tab
- Normalize: Fix bug with VALUES lists that contain function calls
- Clean up repetitive (?), (?), ... query text
- Correctly parse config values that have multiples of megabytes as units


## Performance improvements

- Add index on `log_files(server_id, collected_at)`
- Reduce the amount of query origins fetched for query details page
- Add indices for snapshot deletion task
- Speed up query detail page for queries with many samples or log lines
