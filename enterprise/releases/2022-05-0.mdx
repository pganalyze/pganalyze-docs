**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2022.05.0`

## Notes

* This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
* There are two [security bugfixes](#security) contained in this release that protect against malicious use of manage/API permissions by an internal actor - upgrading is recommended
* We've included a number of backend-only changes for the upcoming version of the Index Advisor
  - We're looking forward to share the new version with you soon!


## Features

- Index Advisor query analysis improvements
  - Support more data type functions
  - Fixed many cases of `Unexpected execution of function` errors
  - Fix MergeAppend handling
  - Find extensions used in custom types
  - Support existing indexes that reference UDFs
  - Custom function support
  - Custom range type support
- Preserve whitespace when showing Postgres config settings
- Update embedded Postgres docs
  - This refreshes the bundled Postgres docs used on config settings pages to the latest releases
    (previously these were out of date, showing older versions of Postgres in some cases)
- Add support for Crunchy Bridge database provider
- Introduces a default log quota of "1 GB log data / server / day" to avoid busy servers overly consuming log processing resources
  - If you'd like to raise the default quota on your installation, please [reach out to us for instructions](mailto:support@pganalyze.com)
- Index advisor query analysis: Move background process to a dedicated queue, and run daily (instead of continuously)
  - If you've seen queue backlogs in the last Enterprise release, this should most likely resolve the backlog issues
- Log Insights improvements
  - Add support for Postgres 14 autovacuum and autoanalyze log events
  - Add regexp match for "permission denied for table" event
  - C22 Auth failed event: Detect additional DETAIL information
  - Handle non-UTC/non-local log_timezone values correctly


## Performance

- Increases table statistics processing performance for servers with a lot of databases
- Snapshot API: Turn off KMS retries and lower timeout to avoid API server timeouts
- Improve performance for per-table query list
- Improve performance for per-database table list
- Analyze all newly created partitions twice (at different intervals) to improve query plans
- Partition connection monitoring data (`backend_counts` table) for better scalability


## Bugfixes

- Ensure all statistics snapshots are only processed once by adding a unique index
- Fix typecast problem when using Postgres 14 for statistics database
- Improve Weekly Report rendering in Outlook
- Avoid wrapping table headers when space is tight
- Improve rendering of wait events graph data to avoid visual display bugs
- Update `<query text unavailable>` guidance for clarity
- Slack integration: Fix double redirect bug for errors
- Log analysis: Avoid crashing when config settings are missing
- Avoid recurring loading flash on connections view
  - This restores the intended behaviour that keeps the old data visible until
    the next data is loaded (whilst auto-refresh is active)
- Query text truncation improvements (used in overview):
  - Correctly handle UPDATE and ON CONFLICT target lists
  - Simplify VALUES lists
- Query analysis: Time out background task after 1 minute
  - This ensures overly complex queries don't consume the system's capacity
- Avoid use of temporary tables, reducing churn on `pg_catalog` table
- Bundled local collector updated from 0.42.0 to [0.43.1](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0431------2022-05-02)
  - Fix cleanup of temporary files used when processing logs
  - Filter out vacuum records we cannot match to a table name
  - Check citus.shard_replication_factor before querying citus_table_size


## Security

- **Security bugfix:** Sanitize local collector values to prevent malicious settings running arbitrary commands
  - This protects against an internal actor who has manage permissions on the
    organization. Previously, they could exploit local collector configuration
    settings to run arbitrary commands within the Enterprise container
- **Security bugfix:** Snapshot API: Improve validation of locations against permitted paths
  - This protects against an internal actor who has a valid API key to trick the server
    into deleting arbitrary paths on the local filesystem of the Enterprise container
- Enables Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in the pganalyze app
- Dependency updates (none of these are exploitable, to our knowledge, but may have shown in dependency scanners)
  - Update google-protobuf gem to address [CVE-2021-22569](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22569)
  - Upgrade Rails to address [CVE-2022-27777](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2022-27777-possible-xss-vulnerability-in-action-view-tag-helpers/80534) and [CVE-2022-23633](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23633)
