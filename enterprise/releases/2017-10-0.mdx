**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2017.10.0`

## New features

- Authenticate with Google Apps
  - As an option, users can now authenticate with Google Apps when logging into
    a pganalyze Enterprise Server instance, see [documentation](/docs/enterprise/google-auth)
- Introduce new check-up and alert configuration system
  - Make minimum calls for query slowness check configurable
- Log Insights: Query sample collection
  - Collects specific query texts found in the Postgres logs based on `log_min_duration_statement`
    and shows them on the query details page
- Allow configuring `pg_stat_statements_reset` frequency on server settings
- Add autovacuum monitoring and visualization
  - See [announcement post](/blog/visualizing-and-tuning-postgres-autovacuum) for details,
    this feature currently needs to be enabled manually, reach out to support for help
- Add connection tracing
  - This feature needs to be enabled manually and is turned on together with autovacuum monitoring
  - New long-running query alert that alerts on currently running queries (based on `pg_stat_activity`)
- Add /ping/collector endpoint to check snapshot health of all servers
  - Use this endpoint in your existing monitoring tools to verify that pganalyze
    is working correctly and gathering statistics from your Postgres database
- Show Postgres role on query detail page
  - Previously we only showed the query fingerprint, but queries are actually
    unique to the set of `[ database, postgres role, fingerprint ]`


## Bugfixes

- Fixes for LDAP Integration / SSO
- Show the correct fingerprint on query details page
- Update pg_query to Postgres 10 parser and fingerprint version 2
- Ensure lower-cased user emails are unique
- Link to connection trace from Log Insights (when feature is enabled)
- Adjust work_mem check to use shared buffers instead of total RAM
- Avoid generating new critical issues due to description changes
- Make debug info more useful in the case of collector errors
- Layout fixes for overly long server names
- Various Log Insights UI improvements


## Performance Improvements

- Speed up query overview details query
- Use react-virtualized for query overview table to improve performance
- Switch to client-rendered views for most pages (this also adjusted the UI design slightly)
