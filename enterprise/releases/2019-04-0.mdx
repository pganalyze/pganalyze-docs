**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2019.04.0`

## New features

* **[General availability of connection tracing, wait event and vacuum monitoring](/blog/postgres-connection-tracing-wait-event-analysis-and-vacuum-monitoring)**
  - Added wait events graph
  - Redesigned vacuum monitoring, shows currently running vacuums in more detail
  - Add clickable connection graph to server connections page
  - Track TOAST flag for vacuum runs
  - Connections: Show backend type in addition to application name
  - Note that this is disabled for already existing servers - you need to enable
    "Activity Sampling" on the server settings page for those servers
* Remove 5 server limitation for high-frequency query statistics
  - This is no longer necessary with new collector versions, since they handle
    multiple configuration entries in parallel
* Add list-focused organization and server overview pages
  - These are now enabled by default when viewing more than 10 databases in
    the organization overview, or more than 5 databases in the per-server view
* Add API for adding servers
* Add Log Insights to server-wide namespace, in addition to per-database
  - This also hides all log events that are not database-specific from the
    per-database view, to avoid any confusion which events affect a particular
    database instead of the whole server
* Gather correct overall size for partitioned tables
* Change query "I/O %" to "% of All I/O", rework query table logic a bit

## Bugfixes

* Index Check: Refactor query <=> table associations to be text-based instead
  - Previously we used table IDs for this, which led to all kinds of problems
    when tables temporarily disappeared (which led to the Index Check failing)
* Postgres roles: Filter our roles from failed logins
  - This can be confusing to the user as any role that had a failed login
    attempt, even if it doesn't exist, used to show up in the roles list
* Don't process as default member if invitation is present
  - This avoids the duplicate creation of a new user, if the user has
    actually been invited by email and is accepting their invite during
    signup
* Don't mark databases created by activity snapshots as legacy default
* Ignore bogus RDS disk statistics
* Server dashboard: Avoid showing "0" text when some data is not available
* Query origin parsing: Fix crash case for ",=" character combination
* Notification worker: Don't notify for issues that got fixed in the meantime
  - This is particularly useful if we are having statistics processing delays,
    so old notifications for realtime checks might have resolved themselves
* Historic query stats: Skip very old statistics
* Catch unique constraint violations in query stats processing
* Check configuration: Require modify privileges on database
* Show TOAST size on table detail pages
* Enable features check: Ignore v11 settings that are disabled by default

## Performance improvements

* Partition log lines and log files by time
* Vacuum Run: Avoid unnecessary sort for retrieving some stats
* ConnectionGraph: Remove unnecessary data being loaded
* Avoid loading table/index issues unnecessarily
* Reduce allocations for query details endpoint, move to dataload module
* Query slowness check:
  - Optimize index usage
  - Run once a day, instead of every 30 minutes
* Partition backend_queries table to avoid DELETE overhead
* Speed up Log Insights by only loading child lines when necessary
* Avoid UPDATEs on user table for JWT token usage in the API
* Delete unused queries older than 60 days

## Other changes

* Various security updates in third-party dependencies
* Move Postgres Roles and replication pages to server namespace
* Improve page title formatting/styling in some prominent cases
  - In particular this aims to avoid confusion as we e.g. have "Dashboard"
    and "Connections" for bot databases and servers.
* Add explicit "Back to Server" and "Back to Organization" in navigation
  - This makes it easier to explain how to get e.g. to organization-wide
    settings, which currently would require using the dropdown and clicking
    again on the currently selected organization
