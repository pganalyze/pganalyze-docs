**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2019.04.1`

## New features

* **Note:** This release is a backport release, without any statistics database changes
  * If you are currently on the **v2019.04.0** release, you can simply swap the image tag to **v2019.04.1**
  * For upgrades from older versions follow the [upgrade guide](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
* Update logo to match new pganalyze brand
* Add support for AWS API [custom endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)
  * Use the following new environment variables to set a non-standard endpoint:
        * `AWS_ENDPOINT_S3_URL`
        * `AWS_ENDPOINT_KMS_URL`
        * `AWS_ENDPOINT_SIGNING_REGION`
        * `AWS_ENDPOINT_RDS_URL`
        * `AWS_ENDPOINT_EC2_URL`
        * `AWS_ENDPOINT_CLOUDWATCH_URL`
        * `AWS_ENDPOINT_CLOUDWATCH_LOGS_URL`
* Refresh license every 24 hours
  * This avoids interruption when an Enterprise license gets renewed
  * Deactivate this behaviour with `LICENSE_KEY_NO_REFRESH=1`
* Allow setting collector timeouts in server settings
  * This can be utilized to permit the collector to take longer to retrieve query texts on very busy databases
* Mailer: Add `MAILER_SSL_VERIFY_MODE` config
  * Use `MAILER_SSL_VERIFY_MODE=none` to disable TLS verification for the mail server
  * Fixes issue where previously when using a self-signed cert for your mail server (e.g. on an internal
    subnet), pganalyze would fail to send mails
* Default production log level to info, allow override with `RAILS_LOG_LEVEL`
  * This significantly reduces the log volume that the pganalyze container produces
* Add support for Amazon RDS 2019 SSL certificate
* Log retention: Always allow 30 days log retention
