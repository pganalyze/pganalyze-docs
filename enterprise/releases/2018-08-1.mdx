## Bugfixes

- Fixes `rake db:setup` for initial setup on Postgres 9.6 and older
- Disables high frequency query statistics collection when more than 5 servers are configured
  - This caused issues due to the collector currently running serially for Enterprise Edition,
    we are working on introducing parallelism here, and will re-enable this feature once
    parallel statistics collection is available
- Fix query statistics `collected_interval_secs` for full snapshot with historic stats
  - Previously this was hard-coded as 60, which is not correct when the full
    snapshot takes longer to run (e.g. because the collector handles multiple
    servers in serial)
