**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2022.08.1`

## Notes

* This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
* This is mainly a bugfix release to address Postgres connection issues and IAM authentication issues with certain configurations reported with the [v2022.08.0](2022-08-0) release


## Features

* Update collector inside pganalyze Enterprise Server image to [v0.45.1](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
  - Auto-detect Aurora writer instance, as well as reader on two-node clusters
    - Previously it was required to specify the individual instance to support log downloads and system metrics, but this now happens automatically
    - The cluster name is auto-detected from the hostname, make sure to not specify the AWS DB Instance ID manually for the auto-detection to work
    - This requires giving the IAM policy for the collector the `DescribeDBClusters` permission
    - In case more than one reader instance is used, each reader instance must be specified individually instead of using the readonly cluster hostname
  - Amazon RDS/Aurora: Show instance role hint when running collector test
  - Amazon RDS/Aurora: Show permission errors during log download
* Better handling of complex queries with parse trees more than 100 levels deep
  - Previously query analysis could not be performed on such queries, causing
    them to not have links to table references, and hiding them from Index Advisor


## Bugfixes

* Fix Postgres connection errors for certain configurations
* Fix handling of IAM authentication with instance roles (when object storage is enabled)
* Periodic worker restarts have been modified to run every 6 hours (instead of 30 minutes)
  - This avoids issues with frequent restarts causing snapshots or automatic
    analysis to be interrupted 


## Security

* Base image security updates (none of these are exploitable, to our knowledge, but may have shown in dependency scanners)
