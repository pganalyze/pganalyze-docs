**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2026.01.0`

## Notes

- This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
- **Important:** If you are currently running v2023.08.0 or older, please [reach out to us](/contact) to walk you through the upgrade process.
  - The query statistics format has changed in this release, and requires upgrading from at least v2024.10.X to keep previous statistics.
- **Important:** This release introduces the "pco" statistics format for internal statistics tables
  - The required data migration runs as part of the `rake db:migrate` upgrade task by default.
  - If your pganalyze installation monitors hundreds of servers or more, this data migration may take **1
    hour** or more to run. See [alternative upgrade guidance](/docs/enterprise/upgrade/#special-note-upgrading-from-earlier-release-to-202601-and-newer) if you want to run the migration of historic data separately.
  - Smaller installation upgrades will typically complete within minutes.
- Postgres 13+ is now required for the internal statistics database used by Enterprise Server <!-- 4784 -->

- This release removes GraphQL fields from `getIssues` API deprecated in [2023.08.0](2023-08-0) <!-- 4916 -->
   - The `displayName`, `referent`, `references.secondaryUrl` fields have been removed from `getIssues`. Please [reach out](/contact) if you need help updating API clients.

## Features

- Enable 100 day retention for query and schema statistics <!-- 5319 -->
  - pganalyze Enterprise Server now stores 100 days (increased from 30 days) of history for query statistics and table/index statistics.
  - The date picker interface has been updated to reflect the additional retention time and to allow selecting longer time frames.

- Query Advisor: Proactive query plan optimization for Postgres is now generally available <!-- 5212 -->
  - Query Advisor continuously analyzes EXPLAIN plans in the background to detect problematic patterns and
  provide actionable query rewrites.
  - Detected issues appear in the Query Advisor landing page, Workbooks, and query detail views.
  - [Learn more in the announcement post](https://pganalyze.com/blog/query-advisor-ga)

- The Query Tuning Workbooks feature is now generally available (GA), and has been renamed "Workbooks"
  - Add list of workbooks related to the query in the query details page <!-- 5303 -->
  - Improve SQL editor with syntax highlighting and auto-completion  <!-- 4832, 5031, 4956, 5144, 5027 -->
  - Support viewing differences between Query Plan variants <!-- 4988 -->
    - When viewing a variant in a Query Tuning Workbook, you can now see any difference in query text, hints or planner settings, as compared to the baseline.
  - Support choosing parameter sets from query samples even if parameters are merged <!-- 5251 -->
    - Previously, merging or renaming parameters caused a "Failed to create a parameter set" error when query samples are selected as parameter sets.
  - Fix parameter type inference when IN lists are used <!-- 5269 -->
  - Show "Run EXPLAIN" option on the overview page when upload is incomplete <!-- 5234 -->
    - Now you can resume the upload directly from the overview, instead of having to go to the variant page.
  - Move the workbook info sidebar on the Overview page from the left to the right side for better consistency across the app <!-- 5089 -->
  - Add built-in diffing option in Editor <!-- 5008 -->
    When drafting a new Query Tuning variant, you can now compare the diff of that draft against the original query.
  - Workbooks: Format and normalize query text using standardized SQL format <!-- 5036 -->
    - To support new diffing option as well as prepare for upcoming Query Advisor functionality, pganalyze Query Tuning Workbooks now always format
      the SQL text in the editor and on variant pages using a consistent format.
     This change also normalizes certain SQL expressions without impacting their meaning, for example `interval $1` will be rewritten to `$1::interval`.

- Further improve internal statistics compression using specialized "pco" format <!-- 5150 -->
  - Adjust the internal query, table and index statistics tables to use the "pco" format for best-in-class compression
    of timeseries data. This is part of te effort to allow increased retention times due to significantly
    smaller storage requirements.

- Combine queries run by multiple Postgres roles <!-- 4874 -->
  - Previously if a query was run by multiple Postgres roles, a duplicate query would exist in pganalyze for each role. Those
    duplicates are now merged into a single query, making pganalyze easier to use if many roles call the same queries. The call
    count for each role can be viewed on the Query Tags page when viewing a specific query.

* Support showing scans information for the index of the partition parent <!-- 4856 -->
  - Previously, if you navigate to the index page of the partition parent, the "Scans on Index" panel didn't have any data to show,
  even though the index is actively used. With this change, the scan information is properly analyzed with the partition parent so
  that the scan information will show up in the "Scans on Index" panel.

* Schema Statistics: Add support for handling named NOT NULL constraints, added in Postgres 18 <!-- 4909 -->

  When running the upcoming Postgres 18 release, you will see columns marked as NOT NULL on each table's "Columns" tab, as well as the automatically
  created named NOT NULL constraints on the "Constraints" tab.

## Other improvements and bugfixes

* Show warning when websocket connection is unhealthy <!-- 5367 -->
  - In 2024 the collector moved to a persistent websocket connection to reduce overhead and enable two-way communication.
  - If your servers haven't been updated to a recent collector version or have networking issues that don't allow the
    connection to stay alive for at least an hour, you will now see an in-app warning. A future major Enterprise release
    will likely drop the legacy API and require a websocket connection.
  - Please [reach out to support](/contact) if you see this warning so we can review your networking setup.

* Ensure logical date ranges like "Last 24h" are resolved appropriately <!-- 5363 -->
  - Currently, when a period like "Last 24h" is selected in the date picker, this is only resolved to a
    concrete date range (e.g., "2025-12-04 00:00:00 to 2025-12-05 00:00:00") once. If you use the app for
    an extended period of time, that resolved date range is stuck in the past and grows stale.
  - Instead, re-resolve the date range periodically (only when navigating to a new page) to ensure fresh data is always loaded.

* Index Advisor
  - Fix handling of queries that reference domains (or tables with domain columns) with NOT VALID constraints <!-- 4748 -->
    - The previous fix did not resolve the issue, and query analysis for these queries was still failing.
  - Support analyzing queries referencing the names with tildes <!-- 4785 -->
    - Previously, when the query is referencing some names (e.g. table names, index names) with tildes, the
      query analysis was failing and the Index Advisor was unable to process.
  - Support analyzing queries with tables referenced in subqueries under WHERE ... IS NULL or IS TRUE <!-- 4954 -->
  - Support schemas that include multiline CHECK constraints <!-- 4883 -->
  - Support extensions installed in pg_catalog schema <!-- 4890 -->
  - Fix "Unexpected rtekind: 2" on certain queries with Postgres 16/17 <!-- 5025 -->
  - Add support for the pgcrypto Postgres extension <!-- 5051 -->
  - Improve support of tables with many scans or columns <!-- 5157 -->
    - When a table has many scans or columns, the number of possible indexes to consider can be very large,
      which was causing OOM and prevented the Index Advisor from running on such tables. This change improves
      memory usage and increases the support for these cases.
    - Note: There are still tables with a high
      number of scans or columns that we are not able to run the Index Advisor on, and we continue to work
      on supporting more of them.
  - Fix color of Considered Index icons in Index Advisor UI <!-- 4851 -->
    - Previously, this icon did not show the index id unless hovered.

* EXPLAIN plans
  - Support I/O Timing data in EXPLAIN with Postgres 17 and above <!-- 4955 -->
  - Support showing EXPLAIN plans containing JIT info using new (Postgres 17) format <!-- 5434 -->
  - Support showing the extra information like the execution time when JSON format view is selected <!-- 5059 -->
    - Previously, when the JSON format view was selected, it was dropping the information like "Planning Time", "Execution Time", "Query Identifier",
    etc.
    - With this change, the JSON format view will show all information captured by auto_explain.
    - If auto_explain is using the text format, it's converted to JSON format on a best effort basis.
  - Default to grid view when showing plans <!-- 5328 -->
    - The grid view for displaying EXPLAIN plans in pganalyze is now the default. It is more compact, and is generally a
      better way to examine EXPLAIN plans. The old "node tree" view may be retired at some point. Please reach out if
      you find features of the node tree view that you would like to see in the grid view, or any other EXPLAIN display feedback.
  - Update the sidebar insight listing for the Grid view <!-- 5117 -->
  - Fix node selection in the Node Tree view <!-- 4913 -->
  - Add some inline details to the EXPLAIN grid view <!-- 5003 -->

* Alerts & Check-Up:
  - Update in-app documentation for the Xmin Horizon Check <!-- 4775 -->
    - Update the [Xmin Horizon Check](https://pganalyze.com/docs/checks/vacuum/xmin_horizon) to format full (64-bit)
      transaction IDs specially. Currently, they are formatted as numbers, but that makes it hard to read the lower
      32-bit transaction ID Postgres sometimes uses (e.g., backend_xmin in pg_stat_activity).
    - Instead, separate the lower 32 bits and the "epoch" (the upper 32 bits) and separate them with `:`.
  - Fix New Slow Query query stats loading problem <!-- 4906 -->
    - This fixes a problem that could occur on issue detail pages for the New Slow Query check
      that would cause stats for the associated query to fail to load.
  - Relax pganalyze:no-alert check <!-- 5326 -->
    - Previously, to skip Active Query and Blocking Query alerts for a specific query, the string `pganalyze:no-alert` was
      required to be embedded in a properly formatted comment. Now, the string can occur anywhere in the query text to
      avoid an issue being created.
  - Improve "Replication: High Replication Lag" check-up <!-- 5205 -->
     - This adds a graph of the replication lag to the Issue page, and clarifies which IP address the affected
       replica is using, instead of naming the follower by internal UUID.

* Log Insights
  - Update overview to improve styling, use consistent colors for each category, and allow collapsing categories <!-- 4924 -->
  - Fix expansion of log line details outside of the main Log Insights page <!-- 5020 -->

* Plan Statistics: Improve display for queries that run infrequently <!-- 5428 -->
  - Previously the plan statistics graphs would show data points where the query didn't run with the dashed area marker,
  typically used for missing data for the whole database/server. Instead, the graphs now show zero at such points when
  there were other queries with activity on that database.

* Drop obsolete mentions of Postgres 9.6-specific functionality <!-- 5411 -->

* Fix over-counting table sizes in table overview stats per database <!-- 5323 -->

* Query Details: Show the most recently seen tags in the Query Tags tab <!-- 4749 -->
  - Previously, when a query had many associated tags, the Query Tags tab displayed an arbitrary limited subset,
    typically showing the oldest tags seen within the last 7 days. We now prioritize the most recently seen tags.
* Fix issue that can cause paginated tables to reset to the first page sometimes <!-- 4744 -->

* Add Inter as a fallback font option for the application UI <!-- 5079 -->

* System / Replication: Improve loading performance of replication follower list <!-- 5204 -->

* Connections: Add ability to select time range in Connection States History graph by dragging with the mouse <!-- 5306 -->

* Show estimated row count for partitions on table list view <!-- 5335 -->

* Schema Statistics: Show View detail page when a view is loaded through the Table detail page <!-- 5375 -->

* Schema Statistics: Show index last used date on list views, making it easier to prioritize unused indexes by their size <!-- 4790 -->

* System Metrics: Improve guidance when buffer cache metrics are not available <!-- 5414 -->

* Config Settings: Update bundled Postgres documentation to include Postgres 18 <!-- 5446 -->

* Fix page focus after loading to allow scrolling the main content with arrow keys <!-- 5054 -->

* Fix long dropdown option text overflowing into "clear" icon in some dropdowns <!-- 5006 -->

* Connection tracing: Don't show incorrect information from newer backend <!-- 4914 -->

* System: Hide unavailable system metrics data for Crunchy Bridge instances <!-- 4922 -->

* Query Samples: Ability to show full parameter values <!-- 4952 -->
  - Currently, the parameter value exceeding 20 characters is truncated. With a new "Show full values" button, it'll expand
  the truncated part and show full values when available. Note that the full value still might not be available depending on
  the log_parameter_max_length setting.

* Email confirmation can now be required <!-- 4679 -->
  - For Enterprise Server setups using email/password logins, you can now optionally require that email addresses
    used are confirmed by clicking a confirmation link. This is only relevant for setups that allow direct user
    signups, and want to verify the email addresses are correct.
  - To enable, set the `CONFIRMABLE_CUTOFF_DATE` environment variable to a particular date. All user accounts created
    after that date will require email address confirmation. Before enabling, ensure that the mailer configuration
    (`MAILER_URL` and related settings) is set up correctly.

* Remove option to sort query stats by query text <!-- 5099 -->
  - This change helps improve request performance. Note that searching by query text is still fully supported.

* Remove mention of no longer existent LDAP_ADMIN_GROUP_CN setting when running `rake db:seed` <!-- 4948 -->
