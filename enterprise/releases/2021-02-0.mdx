**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2021.02.0`

## Notes

* This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
  - Note that the migration might run for a little while (depending on data size) due to some tables being partitioned for better performance
* Old connection tracing data will be lost after this upgrade - note that connection tracing data already has a short retention time (24 hours), so this is usually not noticable
* After upgrading, you may experience connectivity issues for certain Amazon RDS databases when using the `verify-full` SSL mode, this is a [documented bug in Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) (see note regarding Go 1.15),
  and can be resolved by rotating the instance certificate. To mitigate in the short term you can turn off SSL verification for affected instances, which will avoid the problem.

## New features

* Significant navigation refactoring
  - Use single combined navigation, move server/database select to top
  - Move VACUUM statistics, system statistics and Postgres config settings to server level
  - Merge organization and server settings into one "Settings" nav item
* Introduce server-wide query overview
  - As a new standard metric, introduce "Queries Per Second" (QPS) that
    is the indicator of which databases are most active on a particular
    server
* Add per-server schema statistics view that shows stats for each database
* Add per-server EXPLAIN list, showing plans for all databases on a server
* Redesign of the in-app check and alerting experience
* Query details: Restructure the header design to make it more compact
* Navigate to most recently visited recent server when opening the pganalyze app
  - Previously this would go to the very first server in the organization, which
    is often not the server that is most interesting.
* Add option to automatically run pending pganalyze database migrations upon container start
  - Specify `AUTO_DB_MIGRATE=1` in your environment configuration to automatically run the
    `rake db:migrate` command when the pganalyze container starts in web/worker/default mode
  - Note that this assumes you don't have a healthcheck that would shut down the container
    before the migrations have finished, as the migrations are run before the container fully
    starts
* Log Insights
  - Add U140 log event (Inconsistent range bounds)
  - Add support for `%m [%p]: [%l-1] db=%d,user=%u `, `pid=%p,user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h ` and `user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h ` log_line_prefix settings
  - Correctly handle `%a` (application name) containing commas/square brackets
* Other collector improvements (only applicable when running the collector version `0.37.0` or newer separately from the Enterprise image)
  * Add support for GKE workload identity
  * Add support for assuming AWS instance roles
  * Add support for receiving logs over syslog with new `db_log_syslog_server` config setting
  * Add new `pganalyze-collector-setup` program for easier installation on self-managed servers


## Bugfixes

* Schema data processing fixes
  - Fix issue where incomplete schema information in snapshots was not marked correctly, leading to schema objects disappearing and being re-created
  - Avoid broken index information in case of crashes
  - Correctly ignore databases that are not included in the collector's database list
* Query statistics improvements
  - Fix query text normalization when IN list starts with a line break
  - Ignore "insufficient privilege" queries w/o queryid, avoiding misleading statistics
* Automatic EXPLAIN
  - Fix log-based EXPLAIN bug where query samples could be dropped if EXPLAIN failed
  - Improved text to JSON plan conversion (function scans, `track_io_timing` = `on`)
* Environment specific improvements
  * Ignore I/O stats for AWS Aurora utility statements
    * AWS Aurora appears to report incorrect blk_read_time and blk_write_time values
      for utility statements (i.e., non-SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE); we zero these out for now
  * Fix trailing newline handling for GCP and self-hosted log streams
    * This could lead to queries being poorly formatted in the UI, or some queries
      with single-line comments being ignored
  * Ignore internal admin databases for GCP and Azure
  * Self-managed servers: Improve handling of multi-line log events
  * System information for self-managed servers:
    - Use storage mountpoint instead of path to show data directory
    - Fix dashboard display for self-managed servers
* Other fixes
  - Treat missing wait event types as unknown (instead of failing the snapshot)
  - Index check: Ignore (non-materialized) views to avoid unnecessary recommendations
  - Query Samples: Correctly handle NULL parameters
  - Extract query tags from all comments present in query (not just the first one)
  - Active query check: Ignore `walsender: ` connections
 - Allow roles that have deleted users associated to be removed from an organization

## Performance improvements

* Optimize `getQueryStatsForQuery` GraphQL API (used for query details page)
* Optimize `getQueryStats` GraphQL API (used for query overview page)
  - This improvement only applies when all query types are selected, thus this
    is now the default (unless already chosen otherwise)
* Partition additional tables to improve overall performance
* Utilize extended statistics for some internal statistics tables
* Refactor connection tracing data model
  * This significantly reduces the overhead of how connection tracing data is processed and stored
  * Drop application name from frontend (expensive to store)
  * Note that this change causes old connection tracing data to be lost after the upgrade, due
    to the low retention time (24h) this is deemed acceptable
* Schema storage: Group upserts together, reduce peak memory consumption
* Query list: Avoid unnecessary backend calls by debouncing the requests during search
* Collector: Optimize log handling logic for reduced CPU consumption


## Security improvements

* Fixes low-severity security issues in dependencies (CVE-2021-22880, CVE-2021-22881, CVE-2020-26247, CVE-2020-26298 and CVE-2020-15169)
* Updates OS packages used in collector image


## Other changes

* Consistently use "read from disk" for `shared_blks_read`, avoid using hits
  - The query details page and check-up were using a combined read+hit metric
    before, but that can be very misleading since Postgres can access the
    same buffer over and over again during execution, artificially increasing
    the hit counter. Thus, only use the `shared_blks_read` metric when we
    show a byte value in the UI, and consistently call that "read from disk".
* Identify RDS instances by region and account ID to ensure API scope uniqueness
  - Previously we identified RDS databases by there ID and region only, but
    the ID does not have to be unique within a region, it only has to be
    unique within the same AWS account in that region. Thus, adjust the
    scope to include both the region and AWS Account ID (if configured or
    auto-detected), and use the fallback scope mechanism to migrate existing
    servers.
* Log Insights improvements
  - Self-managed server: Process logs every 3 seconds, instead of on-demand
  - Google Cloud SQL: Always acknowledge Pub Sub messages, even if collector doesn't handle them
* Test snapshot: Include link to view server in success message
  - This improves the setup experience for the collector running outside the
    main Enterprise container. Make sure to set the `DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable
    for the URL to be correct.
* Check and report problematic log collection settings
  - Some Postgres settings almost always cause a drastic increase in log
    volume for little actual benefit. They tend to cause operational problems
    for the collector (due to the load of additional log parsing) and the
    pganalyze service itself (or indeed, likely for any service that would
    process collector snapshots), and do not add any meaningful insights.
    Furthermore, we found that these settings are often turned on
    accidentally.
  - The settings in question are:
     * [log_min_duration_statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-MIN-DURATION-STATEMENT) less than 10ms
     * [log_statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-STATEMENT) set to 'all'
     * [log_duration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-DURATION) set to 'on'
     * [log_error_verbosity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-ERROR-VERBOSITY) set to 'verbose'
  - If any of these are set to these unsupported values, all log collection will be
    disabled for that server. The settings are re-checked every full snapshot, and can be
    explicitly re-checked with a collector reload.
* Drop support for monitoring Postgres 9.2
  - Postgres 9.2 has been end-of-life (EOL) for almost 4 years, and is now no longer supported by pganalyze
  - Note that whilst 9.3 and 9.4 are also EOL, we still support them in this release
