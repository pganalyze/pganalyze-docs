**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2018.07.0`

## New features

- [Log Insights 2.0](/blog/postgres-log-monitoring-with-pganalyze)
  - Redesign Log Insights screen for clarity, better zoom-in, links to docs pages
  - Historic Access up to 30 days
      - We've added a new "Jump to Time" selector, as well as other UI elements to
        allow easy navigation to historic log data, up to 30 days into the past
  - Official support for on-premise systems, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora and Heroku Postgres
      - See [documentation](/docs/enterprise/log-insights) for details how to set things up
  - Additional log classifications
  - Log Insights Checkpoint Analysis: Add support for 9.3 and 9.4
- Once-per-minute query statistics (instead of every 10 minutes)
  - Accuracy of query data and graphs has been improved, from the previous statistics
    every 10 minutes, to instead be every minute
  - Graphs update after 10 minutes with the per-minute data (data is loaded in a batch)
- Allow `MAILER_FROM` environment variable to override password-reset email "From:"
  - Previously the password reset emails were sent from support@pganalyze.com,
    which causes issues with some SMTP servers that require a specific whitelisted
    email to be the sender
- Add connections graph on "Connections" page
- Show per-table customized autovacuum settings
- Improved integration with Amazon Aurora
- Add CPU vs I/O time graph on query details page
- Add I/O % to query overview lists
- Add list of "recent issues in last 24 hours" to check config page
- Long running query check: Ignore backups & queries with special comment
- Add "worker" and "snapshot_worker" entry points to support HA configuration
- Add "dbconsole" entrypoint for easier access to the statistics database
- Add summary statistics to vacuum details page (based on log data)
- Add support for ignoring table names for schema processing
  - This currently needs to be set manually on the console

## Bugfixes

- Don't store bogus Heroku system statistics for full snapshots
- Handle exclusively locked relations correctly
- Make sequence report work again behind a feature flag
- Upsert: Ensure that all_ids is correct when using DO NOTHING
- Dataload::Queries: Fix bug in fingerprint to query_id mapping
- RetrySnapshot: Adjust code based on snapshots.snapshot_id being available
- Ensure correct index usage when accessing all indices for a database
- Handle "NULL" value (-1) for replication byte_lag correctly
- Normalize UNENCRYPTED PASSWORD statements correctly
- Fix HAVING clause in index slowness check


## Performance improvements

- Connection tracing processing speed fixes
  - Use Upsert where possible
  - Avoid N+1 situation in StorageV2::Backends#create_referenced_queries
  - Speed up query that is used to close open backends
- Schema processing speed fixes
  - Speed up schema column/constraint processing using `properties_sha1sum`
  - Reduce occurrence of schema_table UPDATEs
  - Indices: Reduce number of fields UPSERTed (instead only INSERT)
  - Use structs instead of hashes
  - Only update indices when the table has changed
- Limit maximum number of schema tables processed per server to 5000
  - This limit will be increased in the future, but serves as a good base line
    for what can be handled currently without issues at the moment
- Add btree_gist indices on backends and vacuum runs
- Add index on schema_indices to support invalid indices check
- Vacuum activity: Preload schema table and postgres role
- Speed up connections list by avoiding N+1 queries
- Add indices to improve loading speed of query details page
