**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2018.08.0`

## New features

- Add index sizes and index age to per-table index list


## Bugfixes

- Restore support for initial install on Postgres versions older than Postgres 10
  - This was accidentally broken in 2018.07.0 due to some Postgres 10 specific
    performance improvements


## Performance improvements

n/a


## Other changes

- **Important - Action Needed:** License keys are now checked when the container is started, not just when the
  container is downloaded
  - Set the LICENSE_KEY environment variable to the same value as the password you
    use for downloading the Docker image
  - This requires the container to be able to make an HTTPS connection (port 443) to
    `enterprise-license-check.pganalyze.com` - if this is not possible in your
    setup please [contact support](mailto:support@pganalyze.com) for workarounds
  - Use `rake enterprise:self_check` to verify that the license key is configured correctly
