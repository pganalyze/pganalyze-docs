**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2021.06.0`

## Notes

* This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
* The query fingerprint format has been changed due to the pg_query 2.0 update - historic data will show as separate query records from the query records for new data


## New features

* Update to [pg_query 2.0](https://pganalyze.com/blog/pg-query-2-0-postgres-query-parser) and Postgres 13 query parser
* Integrate with Slack for alerts about new issues
  - To use the new Slack integration, create your own Slack application for use with pganalyze, and then configure `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`
* Integrate with PagerDuty for alerts about new critical issues
  - To use the new PagerDuty integration, create your own PagerDuty application for use with pganalyze, and then configure the `PAGERDUTY_APP_ID` - reach out to [support](mailto:support@pganalyze.com) for more details
* Introduce server-wide issues
  - Previously certain issues showed up multiple times, once for each database on a server, e.g.
    when a configuration setting should be tuned
  - This is now clearly separated into a server-wide list, with database-specific issues shown separately
  - If you use the public API method `getIssues` we recommend querying by `serverId` instead going forward
* New issue detail page
  - This gives an overview of an issue triggered by a check, shows its
    activity, describes what triggered it and links to the check
    configuration, and offers guidance on how to resolve the problem.
  - E-mail alerts for critical issues now link to this issue detail page,
    and in-app issue lists link to the page as well.
* Use Postgres scanner for syntax highlighting
  - This handles Postgres-specific keywords better when SQL text is shown in-app (e.g. on the query details page)
  - In addition, table references within a query are now linked to the table details page.
* Re-activate weekly reports
  - This was previously turned off for performance reasons, but has now been refactored and improved
  - If `MAILER_URL` is set on your installation all organization members will start receiving weekly report emails every Monday
  - This can be turned off in each user's profile settings (accessible through the link on the bottom left of the navigation)
* Re-activate unused index check
  - This was previously turned off for performance reasons, but is now active again with updated logic
  - Unused indexes are identified as indexes that have not had any scans for 2 weeks
* Members: Add "copy invite link" to invite new members without requiring `MAILER_URL` to be set
* Add support for AWS WebIdentity for use in Amazon EKS
* Per-table VACUUM graph: Full support for 7-day history, improve visual cues
* Per-table ANALYZE: Show related configuration settings

## Bugfixes

* `DEFAULT_ORG_ROLE` now defaults to `none`, ensuring all users that sign up need an invite to join an organization
* Show relation-does-not-exist errors in log-based EXPLAIN errors (instead of "Internal Error")
* Active query / Idle TX check: Only consider backend type "client backend"
* Index invalid check: Increase threshold for when indices are detected from 1 hour to 24 hours (to better handle long `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` builds)
* Minor fixes to EXPLAIN node formatting:
  - Better handling for long CTE names
  - Include Sort Key field as a significant field
  - Fix array-valued significant fields
* Replication followers: Don't list followers without any activity
* Organization-wide database list: Auto-grow server name field
* Upgrade built-in pganalyze collector from 0.37.0 to [0.40.0](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
  - Reduce timeout for accessing EC2 instance metadata service
  - Fix reporting of replication statistics for more than 1 follower
  - Amazon RDS: Support long log events beyond 2,000 lines


## Performance improvements

* Per-table query overview: Optimize backend queries for better performance
* Per-table VACUUM graph: Calculate more data server-side, keeping data sent to client smaller
* Pre-aggregate daily and hourly schema table/index statistics
* Top navigation: Avoid N+1 on each server's database list
* Organization overview: Fix N+1 for loading database counts for each server


## Security improvements

* Update OS base image packages to latest versions
* Update app dependencies for CVE-2021-28965, CVE-2021-22904, CVE-2021-22885, CVE-2021-22903, CVE-2021-22902, CVE-2021-29509, GHSA-7rrm-v45f-jp64


## Other changes

* Rename all user-facing instances of "indices" to "indexes", to match Postgres project terminology
