    and follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)


## Features

- Support for Postgres 18 <!-- 5408 -->
- Support for Plan Statistics captured with [pg_stat_plans](https://github.com/pganalyze/pg_stat_plans)
- Update bundled collector from 0.66.2 to 0.67.0 <!-- 5409 -->
  - See the [collector changelog](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0670------2025-12-08) for the full details
- Add support for converting text plans collected with EXPLAIN (COSTS OFF) to JSON <!-- 4911 -->
- Alerts & Check-Up: Relax `pganalyze:no-alert` check <!-- 5326 -->
  - Previously, to skip Active Query and Blocking Query alerts for a
    specific query, the string `pganalyze:no-alert` was required to be
    embedded in a properly formatted comment. Now, the string can occur
    anywhere in the query text to avoid an issue being created

## Bugfixes

- Enterprise self-check: Correctly handle `MAILER_SSL=none` configuration <!-- 5114 -->
  - This configuration would previously fail to pass the self-check, despite working in practice.
- Fix over-counting table sizes in table overview stats per database <!-- 5323 -->
- Skip pg_query truncation when query text is over 10k characters long <!-- 5342 -->
- Drop unused GeoIP library dependency <!-- 5403 -->
- Correctly parse `X-Forwarded-For` header in snapshot API <!-- 5297 -->
- Avoid internal errors when external redirects encounter unauthorized routes <!-- 5316 -->

## Security

- Redact statement text on server-side for old collector versions <!-- 5369 -->
  - A bug between collector versions 0.60.0 and 0.66.3 caused the collector to not correctly
    redact STATEMENT lines when the full line was redacted, due to an off-by-one bug in the
    replacement code. This is fixed in 0.67.0 but in case the collector has not been upgraded
    yet, this removes any STATEMENT lines on the server side
