**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2020.09.0`

## Notes

* This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)

## New features

* Add search filter for VACUUM history list
* Add search filter for per-table queries list
* Show top 5 databases in database list only
  - Improves situations where a single server has a lot of databases (and the navigation becomes unusable)
  - This list remembers the last 5 databases viewed for a particular server, and shows these in the navigation
  - All other databases can be accessed through a separate link to the per-server database list
* Show additional information about partitioned tables 
* Date picker: Accept default Postgres timestamp format in timestamp input
* Add collector helper `pganalyze.explain(...)` for log-based EXPLAIN access and use if available
  - This lets us avoid granting the pganalyze user any access to the data to follow
    the principle of least privilege
  - See https://github.com/pganalyze/collector#setting-up-log-explain-helper

## Bugfixes

* EXPLAIN plans
  - Don't try to convert JSON explain to text when error present
  - Surface log-based EXPLAIN permission errors
* Locked relations: Ignore table statistics, handle other exclusive locks
* Avoid corrupted snapshots when OIDs get reused across databases
  - This would have shown as data not being visible in pganalyze,
    particularly for servers with many databases where tables were
    dropped and recreated often

## Performance improvements

* Improve data model for snapshots table
* Add index to speed up finding the highest severity issue on a database
* Improve performance of query details pages

## Security improvements

* Multiple security updates to Node.js modules used during web asset generation
  - Whilst pganalyze currently doesn't use Node.js at runtime, these modules might have shown up
    in security scanners and raise unnecessary warnings

## Other changes

* Update to Ruby 2.7.1
* Improve EXPLAIN integration checklist
* Fail fast when `LOG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is configured incorrectly
