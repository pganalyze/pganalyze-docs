## New features

* Introduce Organizations and Roles to replace per-database collaboration model
  - Create one or multiple organizations, each with their set of servers and members
  - Allows the creation of roles that can only access certain databases or servers
  - Roles can be attached to one or multiple users (and each user can have multiple roles)
  - Existing collaborator data will automatically be converted to organization when upgrading
* Add getQueryStats API to export query data
  - See documentation for details
* Log Insights: Visual log statistics for log event categories
  - Log Insights now shows a visualization of log event classifications for the last 24 hours
* Refresh query text every 24 hours
  - Previously we kept the initial query text that is shown on the query details page,
    and never updated it - this change refreshes the text every 24 hours with the
    latest we receive
* Add explicit per-server option to clear query text cache
  - This can be used to reset the query text shown on the query details page,
    reach out to support for instructions how to do so
