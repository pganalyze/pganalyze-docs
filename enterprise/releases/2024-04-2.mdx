**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2024.04.2`

## Notes

- This is a patch release on top of **[2024.04.0](2024-04-0)** and **[2024.04.1](2024-04-1)**
  - This release does not have any new database migrations, and is easy to apply (or rollback)
  - If you're upgrading from a release before [2024.04.0](2024-04-0), be sure to read those release notes, and follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)

## Bugfixes

* Bundled nginx configuration: Increase max file upload size from 1MB to 500MB <!-- 3986 -->
  - This caused larger snapshots (i.e. with lots of statistics data) to fail being processed
* Snapshot API: Correctly respect `X-Forwarded-Proto` header for snapshot upload URL <!-- 4026 -->
  - The `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is typically set by load balancers that do SSL/TLS termination in front of the pganalyze installation
  - Previously the snapshot API server was incorrectly generating `http://` URLs for snapshot upload in such scenarios, despite the API request coming in to an `https://` URL
  - This fixes support for load balancers that do not have an HTTP port listener, on installations that do not have `FORCE_SSL` set to `1` (which avoided this bug, by always requiring SSL/TLS)

## Security

- Routine security updates to packages in the base image
