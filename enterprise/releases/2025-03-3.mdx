**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2025.03.3`

## Notes

- This is a patch release on top of **[2025.03.0](2025-03-0)**, **[2025.03.1](2025-03-1)** and **[2025.03.2](2025-03-2)**
  - This release does not have any new database migrations, and is easy to apply (or rollback)
  - If you're upgrading from a release before [2025.03.0](2025-03-0), be sure to read those release notes,
    and follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)


## Features

- Add additional LDAP authentication settings for SSL certificate verification <!-- 4999 -->
  - Adds `LDAP_ENCRYPTION_CA_FILE` to set the path to CA file to validate server certificate (use a volume mount to provide this file to the container)
  - Adds `LDAP_ENCRYPTION_VERIFY_MODE` to set whether to verify the server certificate ("peer", the default) or not ("none")
  - Note that `LDAP_ENCRYPTION_VERIFY_MODE=none` restores the historic behavior of not verifying the server side certificate, as it was before v2024.10.0.
- Update bundled collector from 0.65.0 to 0.66.2 <!-- 5001 -->
  - See the [collector changelog](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0662------2025-06-25) for the full details
  - Note that some of the new functionality (e.g. pg_stat_io tracking) is not yet enabled in this Enterprise Server release, as this update is mainly aimed to pull in collector-side bugfixes.


## Bugfixes

- Improve reliability of partition creation for internal statistics tables <!-- 4852 and 4860 -->
  - This replaces the mechanism that runs in the background to create daily partition for the internal database, with
    a more reliable method that runs directly in the statistics snapshot workers
  - Resolves errors like "no partition of relation ... found for row" that caused missing data in some cases
- Improve LDAP self-test to accurately report SSL/TLS connection problems <!-- 4999 -->
- Connection tracing: Don't show incorrect information from newer backend <!-- 4914 -->
- Index Advisor: Don't fail with "internal error" in certain cases when handling queries involving 2 or more tables <!-- 4910 -->
