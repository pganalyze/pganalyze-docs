**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2020.07.0`

## Notes

* **We recommend upgrading [2020.07.2](/docs/enterprise/releases/2020-07-2) or newer to avoid a bug related to duplicate server entries**
* **Important:** This release requires at least PostgreSQL 10 for the pganalyze statistics database. Please make sure to upgrade your Postgres version if you are using an older Postgres release.
* This release includes all bugfixes from the [2019.04.1](/docs/enterprise/releases/2019-04-1) patch release
* Upgrades need to follow our [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade) to run necessary database migrations

## New features

* **[New Charts and Date Picker](/blog/introducing-new-charts-and-date-picker)**
* **[Automated Postgres EXPLAIN Visualization & Insights](/blog/automated-postgres-explain-plan-visualization-and-insights)**
* New in-app design to match new pganalyze colors and logo
* Consistent date selection when navigating across the app
* New "Query Tags" section for queries to show where queries originate from
* Improved Query Performance Overview
  - 7-day trend analysis
  - Save query filter options across sessions
* Improved Platform support
  - Amazon RDS: Add RDS 2019 certificate support
  - Azure DB for PostgreSQL and Google Cloud SQL: Add support for Log Insights & EXPLAIN plans
* Alert policies
  - Ability to configure different alert policies for different team members
* VACUUM statistics
  - 7 day retention for detailed statistics (increased from 24h)
  - 30 day view of dead tuples for tables (increased from 24h)
* Smarter server list in navigation menu
  - Shows 5 most recently visited servers
  - This avoids issues when having a lot of servers (which are better viewed on the per-organization server list)
* Update wait events to include Postgres 12 support
* Add 7-day trend analysis to table overview

## Bugfixes

* Log Insights
  - Ensure that "temp file created" log events correctly filter for database
  - Improve in-app integration instructions to be correct for setup type
  - Fix Checkpoint Starting and Temp File Created bucketing for larger timeframes
  - Fix visualization bugs for Z00 classification of unknown log lines
  - Connection tracing: Fix connection logs for cases where the `log_line_prefix` is missing %d
* Internal Enterprise Server logging
  - Always output webserver logs to stdout, and hide request_id to make logs easier to read
  - Don't run collector in verbose mode
* Verify `MAILER_URL` setting when doing self-check
* Default to "localhost" for email application domain instead of "pganalyze.com"
  - We recommend setting `DOMAIN_NAME` to have the correct hostname used in emails sent by the system
* Turn off automatic retries for statistics snapshot processing
  - This didn't work correctly before and caused unnecessary unique constraint violation errors
* System data: Fix accidental reversal of network receive and transmit stats
* Query details: Fix link pointing to Postgres role

## Performance improvements

* Pre-aggregation of multi-hour/multi-day statistics
  - This helps speed up the Query Performance view, as well as Log Insights views
* Improve performance for per-table query performance list
* Avoid timeouts processing high number of Postgres functions, cap at 5000 functions
* Improve per-server connection graph performance
* Improve Log Insights client-side performance
* Improve performance for VACUUM timeline and VACUUM history
* Paginate query performance list
* Server-side pagination for table/index/function lists
* Connections list: Automatically stop polling after 1 minute (reduces server performance impact)

## Security improvements

* Non-critical security updates
  - rails (CVE-2020-8185, CVE-2020-8184, CVE-2020-8162, CVE-2020-8164, CVE-2020-8165, CVE-2020-8166, CVE-2020-8167, CVE-2020-5267)
  - websocket-extensions (CVE-2020-7663)
  - puma (CVE-2020-11077, CVE-2020-11076, CVE-2020-5247)
  - json (CVE-2020-10663)
* Invalidate all sessions on logout (to prevent reusing the session cookie)
* Use secure cookie flag when `FORCE_SSL=1` is configured
* Add rate limiting for the following actions:
  - Signups (protect against spamming a publicly available installation with bogus accounts)
  - Login (protect against brute-force a user's password)
  - Password reset (protect against flood a user's inbox and lock them out)
* Filter out non-word characters in invite e-mail bodies (to avoid abuse of the invite system for sending spam)
* Fix XSS issues with notice messages
* Introduce audit events for significant user initiated/affecting actions
  - For now this is available in an internal table only. This covers the signup, login, password change and member invitation flows.

## Other changes

* Update included pganalyze collector for Enterprise to [0.31.0](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
* Add an explicit Postgres version check (PostgreSQL 10 or newer is now required)
* Improve color scale colors for tree maps and VACUUM timeline
* Rename "self-hosted servers" to "self-managed servers"
* Per-server API keys are no longer created
  - They can still be used for compatibility purposes, going forward the collector utilizes organization API keys for authentication
  - We may deprecate that usage and fully remove per-server API keys in the future, please ensure you use organization API keys when running the collector separately from the main pganalyze container
* Send cookies with API requests
  - This helps support reverse proxy setups, such as when using Cloudflare
    Access (which requires the special `CF_Authorization` cookie to be passed)
* Add Docker command to perform automated actions using the Rails runner command
  - This should not be needed in normal operations, but may be used to help with support requests
* Data retention
  - Historic data is now consistently 35 days (Query Performance data) or 7 days (Log Insights data) across the system
  - Previously additional data was stored, but not accessible, which caused performance issues
  - Add appropriate feature notices for pages with limited data available (e.g. Connection Traces)
