**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2021.12.0`

## Notes

* This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
* This release introduces the [pganalyze Index Advisor](/blog/introducing-pganalyze-index-advisor), note that due to the additional background processing you may need additional worker capacity

## New features

* Index Advisor
  - This is a major new feature - you can read more about it in our blog posts:
    - [A better way to index your Postgres database: pganalyze Index Advisor](/blog/introducing-pganalyze-index-advisor)
    - [How we deconstructed the Postgres planner to find indexing opportunities](/blog/deconstructing-the-postgres-planner)
* Single Sign-On with SAML, supporting Okta & others
  - You can now enable Single Sign-On using the Integrations page (under Settings)
  - Once enabled the main login page will ask users to login with SSO instead
  - Note that existing users with conflicting email addresses will need to change their email or have their user removed before SSO logins are permitted
* Add updateServer and deleteServer GraphQL mutations
  - These can be used for automating updating the pganalyze configuration, e.g. to adjust the database hostname when using the local built-in collector
* Track custom types for the Index Advisor
* Track table column statistics (collected by ANALYZE) for the Index Advisor
  - This only collects frequency and similar information, not actual table values
  - Note this requires adding the special `get_column_stats` [helper function](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector#setting-up-a-restricted-monitoring-user) when using the restricted monitoring user
* Update to [pganalyze-collector 0.41.2](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
* Increase per-server table limit
  - This adjusts the maximum permitted number of tables to 100,000 tables (from 5,000)
  - Note that you may run into statistics processing timeouts on some systems when monitoring higher table counts
* Show EXPLAIN plans on query detail graph
  - This makes it easy to find outliers recorded via `auto_explain` or log-based EXPLAIN, directly in each query's runtime performance graph
* Check-up: Group multiple references for an issue when appropriate
  - e.g. this now groups together long-running idle transactions for the same role, or unused indexes on the same table


## Bugfixes

* Docker image: Use setpriv consistently for dropping privileges
* Improve Enterprise license check error handling (e.g. when running into a firewall issue)
* Enterprise self check: Don't test Redis connection if its built-in
* Fix server issue links in e-mail notifications
* Ignore explains with errors for weekly reports
* Fix undefined region handling in database-level query performance summary
* Shorten 'Queries Per Second' column heading to 'Queries / Second' to fix styling issue
* Check-up: Fix coalescing almost-concurrent email issue notifications
* Check-up: Avoid errors when role not present when processing connection issues
* Improve query normalization of "GROUP BY" clauses
* Query Details Graph: ignore clicks when no corresponding EXPLAIN found
* Add `<unparsable query>` to special query texts


## Performance improvements

* Improve performance of loading EXPLAIN plan lists
* Improve API authentication performance
* Improve performance of processing compact snapshots (activity, logs, system data)
* Optimize schema processing (to allow higher table limits)
* Improve issue loading performance for organizations with many members

## Security improvements

* Update OS base image packages to latest versions
* Update app dependencies for CVE-2021-41136, CVE-2021-30151, CVE-2021-22942, CVE-2021-32740


## Other changes

* We have upgraded our front-end build pipeline (from webpack to Vite/esbuild), if you encounter styling issues or browser compatibility issues, [please let us know](/contact)
