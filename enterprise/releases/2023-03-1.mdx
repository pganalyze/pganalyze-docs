**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2023.03.1`

## Notes

- This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)

## Features

* The bundled collector has been updated to [v0.49.2](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0492------2023-03-30) (from v0.49.0 in prior release)
  - Increases maximum time allowed for activity snapshots (this may fix occurrences of missing connection tracing data compared to the prior release)
  - Fixes issues related to locks held during schema statistics collection
  - Fixes handling of failures of the optional pg_stat_statements_reset() logic (if enabled but the permissions were not set correctly)
  - See [full collector changelog](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0492------2023-03-30)
* The included Amazon RDS and Aurora SSL certificate bundle has been changed to utilize the new global CA set
  - This supports both the "rds-ca-2019" certificate, as well as more recently announced CAs such as "rds-ca-rsa2048-g1"


## Performance

* Index Advisor: Reduce interval for re-checks when queries and schema remain unchanged
  - Previously such tables were checked every second day, but they are now only checked weekly to reduce overhead for infrequently used tables
  - If the queries or table changes that kicks off a new Indexing Engine run
* Query analysis: Speed up handling of queries with foreign key references, by only going one level deep
  - The generic plan costs are only affected by direct foreign key relationships, so we can save some cycle this way
* Improve performance of Index Advisor overview page


## Bugfixes

* Enterprise Server migrations: Fix bug in migration "20221215023958_drop_replication_stats_and_old_vacuum_run.rb"
  - If you attempted to upgrade to the Enterprise Server release [v2023.03.0](2023-03-0) you might have run into a failure in this migration - this bugfix resolves that error
* Enterprise Server setup: Avoid unnecessary "BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou" error when initializing storage buckets
* Query analysis: Fix handling of AlternateSubPlan nodes in generic query plans
* Automated EXPLAIN: Prefer storing samples with EXPLAIN plans when too many samples are received within the same timeframe
  - This resolves some edge cases where a query sample was visible, but no EXPLAIN plan, despite a plan having been collected
* Type width estimates: Avoid errors for certain variable-length types provided by extentions (geometry, citext)
* Alert policy configuration: Remove "Coming soon" flag from blocking queries check


## Security

* Fix unrelated vulnerabilities that may have been flagged in dependency scanners
  * Rails: CVE-2023-27539 and CVE-2023-28120
  * Rack: CVE-2023-27530
  * Update rust-openssl
