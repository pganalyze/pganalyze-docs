  - This release does not have any new database migrations, and is easy to apply (or rollback)
  - If you're upgrading from a release before [2025.03.0](2025-03-0), be sure to read those release notes,
    and follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
- We recommend upgrading as soon as possible if you are utilizing SAML authentication in pganalyze
  - **Security impact:** The resolved [CVE-2025-25291](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25291) and [CVE-2025-25292](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25292) in ruby-saml would have allowed
    impersonating any member within your pganalyze organization by an internal threat actor with
    existing access to your SAML application or SAML identity provider (for example escalating from a view-only role to one that allows modifying server configuration in pganalyze)
