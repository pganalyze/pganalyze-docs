**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2024.04.1`

## Notes

- This is a patch release on top of **[2024.04.0](2024-04-0)**
  - This release does not have any new database migrations, and is easy to apply (or rollback)
  - If you're upgrading from a release before [2024.04.0](2024-04-0), be sure to read those release notes, and follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)

## Features

* Index Advisor
  - Add support for "pg_bigm", "cube", "earthdistance" and "ltree" extensions <!-- 3953 and 3957 -->
  - Add ability to filter out acknowledged state insights <!-- 3943 -->

## Other improvements

* Improve support of read-only filesystems by writing license response file to temporary folder <!-- 3935 -->
  - This avoids having to make the `/home/app` folder writeable for the `license_response.json` file, and
    instead only requires the `$TMPDIR` folder (typically `/tmp`) to be writeable.
* Add option to source `$INIT_SCRIPT` at startup <!-- 3974 -->
  - This enables easier use of external secret management tools in a Kubernetes environment,
    since you can now directly have the container source a file previously written in an init
    container, instead of having to manually use "bash -c" to source that file first. To use,
    first have an init container write a file to a volume mount, and then mount that same volume
    to the main pganalyze container and set `INIT_SCRIPT` to the file location. The file should
    contain `export VARIABLE=value` statements, e.g. to set the `LICENSE_KEY` or `DATABASE_URL`
* Allow configuring ports used inside Enterprise Server container <!-- 3969 -->
  - This allows overriding the following port settings:
    - `PORT` (default to 5000), where the reverse proxy listens for HTTP requests
    - `SSL_PORT` (default to 5001), where the reverse proxy listens for HTTPS requests
    - `APP_PORT` (default to 5002), where the main app listens for the reverse proxy
    - `SNAPSHOT_PORT` (default to 5003), where the snapshot API listens for the reverse proxy
  - We only recommend changing these when needed and recommend not changing `APP_PORT` and `SNAPSHOT_PORT`
    as they should be considered internal details that are subject to change
* Add support for built-in nginx to Enterprise slim images <!-- 3966 -->
  - This was added in the last Enterprise release ([2024.04.0](2024-04-0)) to support reverse proxying to either the
    regular application or the snapshot API on the same port (5000), depending on path.
  - However we omitted to properly support this for the slim Enterprise images at the time. This adds
    the package, allowing to run "web" for starting up a web server that handles both regular app
    requests and the snapshot API
* Allow directly running Enterprise Server "slim" image as non-root user <!-- 3936 -->
  - Generically the Enterprise Server image will drop privileges to the "app" user as soon as it can, but
    container boot-up was historically still done as the "root" user inside the container.
  - With this change, when using the Enterprise Server "slim" images (that is, the images which do not run an init system,
    requiring separate containers/pods to be deployed for different functions, such as web/worker/collector),
    you can now specify the app user (`app`, UID 1000) directly on the container host, guaranteeing the
    container guest OS never runs as root
* Automated EXPLAIN
  - View EXPLAIN Source: Hide "Async Capable" field when converting from JSON to text format <!-- 3946 -->
  - Add a better support for handling new lines with the text log format <!-- 3937 -->
  - Correctly convert I/O timing output for Postgres 15+ to JSON format if needed <!-- 3948 -->


## Bugfixes

* Bundled nginx configuration: Correctly handle `X-Forwarded-Proto` set by upstream load balancers / proxies <!-- 3934 -->
  - This avoids SSL related redirect problems, or SAML single-sign on issues caused by the recent addition
    of nginx as a reverse proxy inside the Enterprise Server container image.
* Index Advisor:
  - Avoid Internal Error for tables that had no scans/query activity in the last 7 days <!-- 3956 -->
  - Avoid errors when unsupported index types/data types are referenced by a table <!-- 3954 -->

## Security

- Routine security updates to packages in the base image and library dependencies
