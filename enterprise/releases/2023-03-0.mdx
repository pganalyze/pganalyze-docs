**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2023.03.0`

## Notes

**Important:** When upgrading from an older release you may run into an error running migrations. We recommend upgrading directly to [v2023.03.1](2023-03-1) instead to avoid this migration error.

- This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
- New minimum Postgres version for monitored servers: **Postgres 10 or newer**
- New minimum required pganalyze collector version: [0.38.0](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0380------2021-03-31) or newer
  - You may need to upgrade the collector if you run it outside the Enterprise Server container
- Updated query fingerprinting mechanism to be compatible with Postgres 15
  - You may see some queries in the system appear as new query records after the upgrade

## Features

- **Lock Monitoring**
  - In the Connections view, you can now clearly see when queries are blocking each other, and find the root query blocking others
  - New check-up for "Blocking Queries", which can proactively alert you of locking problems
  - Read more in the [announcement blog post](https://pganalyze.com/blog/postgres-lock-monitoring)
- Index Advisor improvements
  - New status page that shows when Index Advisor last processed a table, as well as any errors
  - Improve row size estimates for Index Write Overhead
  - Multiple fixes to query analysis phase
    - If you've previously seen Index Advisor errors, these may now be resolved after the analysis has re-run (typically takes up to 24 hours)
  - Missing indexes:
    - Speed up detection of missing indexes on newly added databases
    - Detect newly added indexes that resolve a missing index recommendation right away
    - Add support for fuzzystrmatch and unaccent extensions
    - Avoid errors on materialized views involved in a schema definition
    - Fix costing for Bitmap Heap Scans on existing indexes
  - Unused indexes:
    - Increase lookback period to 35 days by default, and make it customizable
    - Improve handling of partitioned tables to determine whether an index is unused
- Query tags improvements
  - Add full support for [sqlcommenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/) syntax, including trace context
  - Better detection of query comments by using Postgres scanner (instead of regexp matching)
- Support for Postgres 15, including new query syntax
  - Adds support for newer Postgres syntax added in 14 and 15, such as the MERGE command
  - Note that this will cause query entries to reset in some cases, due to updates to the query fingerprint
- Bundled collector upgraded to release [0.49.0](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0490------2023-02-27) (from v0.45.1 in the prior release)
  - Enforce maximum time for each snapshot collection
    - This will help ensure consistent reporting intervals for collectors with a lot of monitored servers, and avoid "noisy neighbor" problems during reporting
  - Amazon RDS / Aurora
    - Avoid DescribeDBInstances calls for log downloads for RDS instances
    - Auto-detection of Aurora instances from the cluster hostname
    - Multiple improvements to Log Insights integration
  - Additional statistics tracking for autovacuum and TXID consumption rates
  - Add Postgres 15 support
  - See [full collector changelog](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0490------2023-02-27)
- Better account management
  - Allow calling the membership delete action via the GraphQL API
  - SAML integration: Easier migration of existing users when turning on SAML for the first time
  - SAML integration: Option to add identity provider metadata manually (instead of via URL)
- Improved API key management
  - Ability to create collector and read-only keys directly in the pganalyze UI
  - Ability to revoke API keys (e.g., useful for key rotation)
  - API key values are hidden by default when viewing the API keys page
  - Increased random bytes for API keys for additional protection
  - New API keys now start with a "pga" prefix, to make it easier to identify pganalyze API keys
  - API key usage is now tracked in the `audit_logs` table (at most once per day per client IP)
  - API key creation and revocation is now tracked in the `audit_logs` table
- VACUUM monitoring improvements
  - New per-table graph that shows the age of the oldest unfrozen XID on a table (to help understand anti-wraparound vacuums better)
  - Extend VACUUM data retention time to 35 days (from 7 days)
  - Additionally this release includes preparation for new autovacuum metrics and tuning recommendations, coming in a future Enterprise Server release
- Other improvements
  - Show Amazon RDS / Aurora instance tags on servers in pganalyze
    - For instances with tags applied in AWS (e.g., to indicate which application team owns the instance),
      pganalyze will now automatically show these tags in the server overview list
  - Add `DISABLE_DIRECT_SIGNUP` setting to prevent uninvited users from registering a user account
    - In case you are hosting your pganalyze instance on a publicly accessible host, we recommend enabling this new setting as an extra measure to prevent unexpected user registrations
    - See [details on access control settings](/docs/enterprise/settings#access-control-settings)
  - Add support for AWS IMDSv2 instance metadata protocol to retrieve credentials for accessing object storage
  - Table columns page: Show NULL % and avg. width (requires [pganalyze.get_column_stats](/docs/install/amazon_rds/02_create_monitoring_user) helper)
  - Connections page: Show Postgres roles for each connection
  - System metrics: Add support for Crunchy Bridge
  - Update in-app Postgres documentation to the latest versions
  - Help identifying queue backlogs by printing background queue statistics to Enterprise Server container output every 10 minutes


## Performance

* Speed up loading of per-query sample list
* Speed up query EXPLAIN plan graph when looking up multiple days
* Reduce storage requirements for Log Insights indexes
* Background workers
  - New Rust-based full snapshot workers
    - This completes the move of the snapshot processing logic to Rust, lowering memory and CPU consumption when processing many statistics
    - No action is needed to migrate to the new workers, they will automatically be in use after upgrading to this release
  - Schema processing:
    - Collect oldest unfrozen XID and MultiXact ID separate from table data, to reduce overhead
    - Limit the number of schema table events processed per snapshot (to avoid timing out in edge cases)
  - Query samples: Avoid collecting unnecessary query samples for the same query within the same log snapshot
  - Queries: Stop storing `received_query` in `queries` table to reduce storage overhead
  - Expiry of old data: Reduce lock contention when handling a large number of servers
  - Index advisor: Reduce overhead of initial query analysis step
  - Improve pre-aggregation queries for hourly/daily statistics buckets

## Bugfix

* Query overview: Default empty query text to `<unknown query text>`
  - This can occur when the pg_stat_statements query text file can't be loaded
* Issue page:
  - Avoid errors when the reference for a check-up issue was removed (due to the data having expired)
  - Show references for the issue even when the problem has been resolved (e.g. individual active queries for an active query issue)
* Replication lag alerts: Correctly average statistics when lag is below threshold
* Fix removal of deleted Postgres roles from pganalyze (they were previously shown even when already removed)
* Connections page: Improve retrieval of historic statistics and show correct query age
* Setup instructions: Add port to local collector configuration
* Query text normalization: Use last complete row in VALUES instead of ? character
* Skip full snapshots missing tables due to locks/timeouts (this avoids tables/indexes disappearing unexpectedly)
* Allow additional special characters in passwords to fulfill complexity requirements
* Avoid errors storing functions with overly long argument lists

## Security

* Update to Ruby 2.7.7 and Rails 6.1
* Use more random bytes for initial admin password
* Fix multiple reported CVEs in modules / packages used by pganalyze
  - None of these are exploitable, to our knowledge, but may have shown in dependency scanners
