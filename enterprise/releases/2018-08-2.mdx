## Bugfixes

- Fix migrations from old Enterprise versions (2016/2017)
- Move check-up workers into a separate queue that is lower priority
  - If the check-up queue gets backed up, the system will now still send emails
    and process other jobs in the default queue
- Fix bug in delete snapshots cron expression (only it run once per day)
  - The previous expression accidentally specified to run * in the 5th hour,
    which meant that we would run 60 deletions of old statistics per day,
    all within the same hour, which consumes unnecessary resources
