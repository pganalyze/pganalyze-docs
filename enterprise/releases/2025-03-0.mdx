**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2025.03.0`

## Notes

- This release requires a database migration when coming from older releases, be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)
- **Important:** If you are currently running v2024.04.X or older, we highly recommend first upgrading to [v2024.10.0](/docs/enterprise/releases/2024-10-0) and staying there for 7 days
  - The v2024.10.0 release introduced a backend change for how Log Insights data is stored. Starting that release the old format was still supported in a dual write mode.
  - Starting with this release the new format is required and the only one supported.
  - If you have not been on v2024.10.0 for sufficient time the migrations will fail with an error to prevent accidental loss of Log Insights data.
- **Important:** If you are currently running v2023.08.0 or older, we highly recommend first upgrading to [v2024.04.5](/docs/enterprise/releases/2024-04-5) and staying there for 7 to 35 days
  - The v2024.04.0 release introduced a backend change for how query statistics are stored. Starting that release the old format was still supported in a dual write mode.
  - Starting with the `v2024.10.0` release (and including this `v2025.03.0` release) the new packed format is required and the only one supported.
  - If you have not been on v2024.04.X for sufficient time the migrations will fail with an error to prevent accidental loss of query statistics.

## Features

- **New Feature:** Query Tuning Workbooks (Beta)
  - [Read the announcement for all the details](/blog/introducing-postgres-query-tuning-workbooks)
  - Add a new permission "Tune Queries" and a new default role "Tune Queries (All Servers)" <!-- 4482 -->
    - This is a permission for the Query Tuning feature. With this permission, the user is allowed
      to run EXPLAIN ANALYZE using the collector.
    - This permission will be turned on with the default role "Admin (All Servers)", and a new
      default role "Tune Queries (All Servers)". Other roles such as "View & Modify (All Servers)"
      will not have this permission by default.
- **New Feature:** [Plan Comparison](/blog/understanding-how-to-compare-postgres-explain-plans)
- **New Feature:** Track Postgres buffer cache usage <!-- 4456 -->
  - [Read the announcement for all the details](/blog/tracking-postgres-buffer-cache-statistics)
  - After upgrading to collector version 0.63.0 and enabling the `pg_buffercache` extension, pganalyze will track buffer cache usage on a per-server basis so you can see which tables use the most memory and how the workload changes over time.
- **New Feature:** [Plan Statistics for Amazon Aurora](/blog/introducing-postgres-plan-statistics-for-amazon-aurora)
- Index Advisor
  - Add support for Postgres 17
  - Support custom extension schemas <!-- 4532 -->
    - This ensures query analysis can complete when extension data types are utilized where the
      extension is installed in a custom (i.e. non "public") schema.
  - Fix handling of queries that reference tables that use domain columns with invalid constraints <!-- 4683 -->
  - Add support for queries using simple expressions involving CURRENT_DATE that may need to be evaluated at plan time <!-- 4433 -->
  - pg_plan: Support additional built-in functions <!-- 4533 and 4433 -->
- Automated EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN Plans
  - Link to plan comparison from EXPLAIN sample list <!-- 4660 -->
  - Improve "no plans found" message <!-- 4492 -->
  - Clean up rendering of node details for sorts that do not spill to disk <!-- 4520 -->
  - Support parsing WindowAgg node with Run Condition with text format EXPLAIN result <!-- 4649 -->
- Update bundled collector from 0.61.0 to 0.65.0 <!-- 4684 and 4721 -->
  - See the [collector changelog](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0650------2025-02-20) for the full details


## Other improvements and bugfixes

- Add `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH` config settings <!-- 4591 -->
  - These settings allow specifying a custom SSL certificate
    and key for the built-in nginx reverse proxy as a path inside the container (e.g. to a
    volume mount), instead of passing in the whole certificate/key with the existing
    `SSL_CERT` / `SSL_KEY` settings.
- Increase nginx worker_connections to 10000 <!-- 4680 -->
  - This avoids errors when sending snapshots of hundreds of servers concurrently to the same pganalyze Enterprise Server container.
- Active query alert: Ignore connections from pg_repack <!-- 4579 -->
- Improve main menu layout for users who belong to many organizations <!-- 4651 -->
- Organization Dashboard: Show inactive servers if no active servers present <!-- 4586 -->
  - The Organization Dashboard includes a list of servers, with a toggle for showing servers
    with no recent snapshots recorded. This sets the toggle to on by default if no servers
    have recent snapshots.
- Index Advisor:
  - Fix highlight of menu item when some tabs are selected <!-- 4643 -->
  - Fix segmentation faults when `AtEOXact_GUC` fails to run on Postgres 16/17
- Server Settings: Show pg_stat_statements info data in Debug Info panel when available <!-- 4664 -->
- Postgres Settings: Add Postgres 17 in-app documentation, and include updates from minor versions for older releases <!-- 4675 -->
- Enterprise Server: Include primary/replica counts in license server information <!-- 4718 -->
  - For installations that use regular license keys, include a count of primary and replica servers
    with recent data in the counts reported to the pganalyze license server. This information is
    used to confirm whether your Enterprise Server installation is within the licensed server limit.
- Enterprise Server: Show warning when exceeding the licensed server limit <!-- 4717 -->
  - This will show a warning in the pganalyze app when an installation exceeds the licensed server count.
- Send keepalive request to websocket connections every 20 seconds
- Speed up Index Unused check <!-- 4542 -->
- Update query parser to support Postgres 17 syntax <!-- 4475 -->
