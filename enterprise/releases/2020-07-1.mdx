**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2020.07.1`

## Notes

* **We recommend upgrading [2020.07.2](/docs/enterprise/releases/2020-07-2) or newer to avoid a bug related to some servers not collecting data**
* This release requires a small database migration when coming from [2020.07.0](/docs/enterprise/releases/2020-07-0), be sure to follow the [recommended upgrade steps](/docs/enterprise/upgrade)

## Bugfixes

* Avoid creation of duplicate servers due to missing API system scope
  - The API system scope `enterprise` is now used for local collector servers
  - If you have upgraded to [2020.07.0](/docs/enterprise/releases/2020-07-0) you will likely have seen duplicate server entries
  - This bugfix resolves the problem, and switches back to using the correct server entries
  - You can remove the duplicate server entries from the "Server Settings" screen after clicking on the server
* Remove requirement to have `uuid-ossp` extension installed
  - UUID generation for the statistics database is now done through `pgcrypto` only
* Require login for in-app documentation
* Fix contact support link to point to support@ email alias
