**Docker tag:** `quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:v2018.09.0`

## New features

* Adds support for Postgres 11
* Automated EXPLAIN plan collection through [auto_explain](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/auto-explain.html) (requires Log Insights)
* Support for fully on-premise Log Insights setup (see [setup guide](/docs/enterprise/log-insights-local))
  * Previously we required log files and snapshots to be stored in an Amazon S3
    bucket, which doesn't always work, especially not when there are strict
    requirements for no data to leave an on-premise data center
  * With this release we now support [Minio](https://www.minio.io/) as an
    on-premise storage backend, which can be run in a self-contained Docker
    container together with a mounted directory for log file storage
  * New environment variables introduced for Minio configuration:
      - `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=XXX`
      - `MINIO_SECRET_KEY=XXX`
      - `MINIO_ENDPOINT=http://minio.internal:9000`
  * We also introduced a new `LOG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` setting, which is used to
    encrypt log files, instead of requiring Amazon KMS
      - The `LOG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` needs to be set to a 256-bit key, and works as a
        keyring. You can generate an appropriate key like this:

          `dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | openssl base64`

      - And then configure it like this in the environment file:

          `LOG_ENCRYPTION_KEY={"1": "base64_encoded_key_here"}`
* Add public GraphiQL installation at /graphiql as "pganalyze API Explorer"
  * This makes it easy to try out pganalyze API calls with the currently
    logged in user
* Add avgBytesLoaded to getQueryStats API endpoint


## Bugfixes

* Query list: Fix sorting by role name, include role name in searches
* Fix incorrect description for "Index Scans" on vacuum details page
* Add special coloring for "cleaning up indexes" vacuum phase


## Performance improvements

* Add missing indices for `postgres_roles` and `log_lines`
* Significantly speed up loading of vacuum run statistics
