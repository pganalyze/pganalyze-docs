pganalyze Enterprise Server is a fully self-contained version of pganalyze that runs
behind your firewall. We recommend using this deploy for storing highly sensitive data
(e.g. medical data or financial services), or other situations where our cloud-based version is not a good fit.

If you'd like to start a trial of pganalyze Enterprise Server in your environment,
**[please contact us](/contact)**.
