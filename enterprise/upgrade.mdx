## Upgrade process

The general upgrade process for pganalyze Enterprise Edition is as follows:

**1. Backup the statistics database (pg_dump or RDS snapshot)**

We recommend you make a backup of the pganalyze statistics database, to be able
to roll back an upgrade easily (see **Recovering from a failed upgrade**). You
don't need to save any other state besides the statistics database, and you can
use a simple `pg_dump` for backing up the database, or any other method that
allows a convenient restore (e.g. Amazon RDS snapshots).

**2. Pull the new pganalyze image**

`docker pull quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[new version]`

Be sure to replace `[new version]` with the specific release you are upgrading
to. You can see the latest release on the [Releases](releases) page.

**3. Stop the currently running container**

`docker stop --rm pganalyze`

**4. Run `rake db:migrate` task in a new container**

Before starting the database migration task, make sure that the `btree_gist` and `pgcrypto` extensions are installed and available.

`docker run --env-file pganalyze.env quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[new version] rake db:migrate`

This will upgrade the database schema for the new release - at this point you need to use the new version,
and can't go back to the old version without recovering from backup (as schemas are not compatible across versions).

**5. Run enterprise self check**

`docker run --env-file pganalyze.env quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[new version] rake enterprise:self_check`

If this returns any errors, please review your environment configuration in `pganalyze.env`.

Also see **Special Notes: Upgrading from earlier releases to 2018.08 and newer** if you are running into a license error.

**6. Start container**

`docker run -d --name pganalyze -p 8080:5000 --env-file pganalyze.env quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[new version]`

At this point you are done and the user interface should load again as expected. Please reach out to us if you run into any issues.

## Recovering from a failed upgrade

In order to recover from a failed upgrade attempt, you need to first stop the
pganalyze container using `docker stop --rm pganalyze`.

Then you would perform a regular database restore operation - on Amazon RDS you
might choose to recover from a snapshot, on other systems you would usually use
`pg_restore` from a `pg_dump` you have done before.

After the backup is restored, start up the container with the old version like this:

`docker run -d --name pganalyze -p 8080:5000 --env-file pganalyze.env quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[old version]`

## Special Notes: Upgrading from earlier releases to 2018.08 and newer

Starting in pganalyze Enterprise [2018.08.0](/docs/enterprise/releases/2018-08-0), the pganalyze
container requires the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable to be configured.

Before starting the new container, set the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable to
the download password that you have been given when first setting up pganalyze Enterprise Edition.

Note that this requires the container to be able to make an HTTPS connection (port 443) to
`enterprise-license-check.pganalyze.com` - if this is not possible in your setup
please [contact support](mailto:support@pganalyze.com) for workarounds.

After setting the `LICENSE_KEY` you can verify using `rake enterprise:self_check`
that the license verification works as expected.
