In order to provide notifications about issues discovered in your database,
pganalyze provides support for integrating with [Slack](https://slack.com/) or
[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com). These integrations require additional
setup for pganalyze Enterprise Edition.


## Slack

First you will need to [create your own Slack
"app"](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics). You should be able to
follow the Slack instructions. It does not need to be a published app. Once
this is done, go through the following:

 1. Under **Oauth & Permissions** in the Slack app, the redirect URLs should
    include the address where you're hosting pganalyze&mdash;e.g.,
    https://app.pganalyze.com for the public pganalyze app
 2. On the same page, the Scopes should be "channels:read" and "chat:write"
 3. Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret and set those as
    `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` in your pganalyze config
 4. Install your Slack app to your Slack workspace: You can do this in Slack
    through the Apps section in the left-hand menu
 5. In pganalyze, go to the Integrations tab in the Settings page and enable
    the Slack integration


## PagerDuty

You will need to [create a new integration in
PagerDuty](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTgw-events-api-v2-overview#getting-started).
You should be able to follow the PagerDuty instructions. Once this is done, go
through the following:

 1. Under **Event Integration** in PagerDuty, the Simple Install Flow should
    include the address where you're hosting pganalyze&mdash;e.g.,
    https://app.pganalyze.com for the public pganalyze app (make sure to
    save your changes when done)
 2. Copy the `app_id` from Integration Setup URL in that same section section,
    and add that to your pganalyze config as `PAGERDUTY_APP_ID` (note that this
    is *not* the same id you see in the URL bar)
 3. In pganalyze, go to the Integrations tab in the Settings page and enable
    PagerDuty integration
