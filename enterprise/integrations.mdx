In order to provide notifications about issues discovered in your database,
pganalyze provides support for integrating with [Slack](https://slack.com/) or
[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com). These integrations require additional
setup for pganalyze Enterprise Server.


## Slack

First you will need to [create your own Slack
"app"](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics). You should be able to
follow the Slack instructions. It does not need to be a published app. Once
this is done, go through the following:

 1. Under **Oauth & Permissions** in the Slack app, the redirect URLs should
    include the address where you're hosting pganalyze&mdash;e.g.,
    https://app.pganalyze.com for the public pganalyze app
 2. On the same page, the Scopes should be "channels:read" and "chat:write"
 3. Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret and set those as environment variables
    `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` in your pganalyze container configuration
 4. Restart the pganalyze Enterprise Server container to apply the new configuration
 5. Install your Slack app to your Slack workspace: You can do this in Slack
    through the Apps section in the left-hand menu
 6. In pganalyze, go to the Integrations tab in the Settings page and enable
    the Slack integration


## PagerDuty

You will need to create a new "application" in PagerDuty:

 1. Go to `https://[your-pagerduty-subdomain].pagerduty.com/developer/applications/new`
 2. Enter a name and description
 3. Under "Functionality", check both "OAuth 2.0" and "Events Integration"
 4. Click "Next" to configure the OAuth portion
 5. Under "Authorization", select "Classic User OAuth"
 6. Under "Redirect URL", add `https://[your-pganalyze-domain]/users/auth/pagerduty/callback`
 7. Under "Permission Scope", select "Read & Write"
 8. Click "Next" to configure the Events Integration
 9. Under "Redirect URLs", add `https://[your-pganalyze-domain]`
 10. Copy the app_id from the Integration Setup URL (the URL will look like `app.pagerduty.com/install/integration?app_id=PN0FNF1&redirect_url=https://[your-pganalyze-domain]&version=2` ­— in this case, the app_id is `PN0FNF1`)
 11. Save the app_id as PAGERDUTY_APP_ID in your pganalyze .env file (e.g., for the above id, that would be `PAGERDUTY_APP_ID=PN0FNF1`)
 12. Click "Register App"
 13. Copy the OAuth client ID and secret and save these for the future (we currently do not use them, but we may extend the integration and require them in the future)

Once these steps are done on the PagerDuty side, you'll need to complete the
integration setup on the pganalyze side:

 1. Restart the pganalyze container to ensure the new `PAGERDUTY_APP_ID` setting is picked up
 2. Log in and go to the Integrations tab on the Settings page
 3. Click "Connect to PagerDuty"
 4. Log in to PagerDuty and select the services you'd like to be able to send pages to, the click Connect. You should be redirected back to pganalyze.
 5. Next to the "Test Integration" button, select a service to send a test alert to and click Test Integration

You should now receive a test page from pganalyze through PagerDuty and the integration will be complete.
