## Setting up an object storage backend

Using pganalyze Enterprise Server with Log Insights requires some additional
configuration for object storage. This is also required
when running a [separate collector installation](/docs/enterprise/separate-collector-install).

The object storage (e.g. Amazon S3) is used for two purposes:

* Statistics snapshots - as a communication channel for sending statistics data
* Log texts - to store log texts for the retention time (7 days)

Please make a choice of which object storage to use and follow one of these two guides:

1. [Local storage using the MinIO storage server](/docs/enterprise/setup/object-storage-local)

2. [Cloud storage using Amazon S3](/docs/enterprise/setup/object-storage-s3)
