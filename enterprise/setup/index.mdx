These are the installation instructions for [pganalyze Enterprise Server](/enterprise-postgres-monitoring), which runs fully-contained within your own environment.

The pganalyze container image is mostly self-contained, and runs various services inside the Docker (or podman) container.

<ToC items={props.toc} />

## Installation steps

### Pre-requisites

* Provision a virtual machine
  * Assign at least 4GB - 8GB of RAM, 1-2 dedicated CPU cores
* Install Docker or podman on your virtual machine
  * pganalyze Enterprise Server is delivered as a container image compatible with Docker / podman
  * When using podman, make sure to replace `docker` with `podman` in the steps below
* Setup a PostgreSQL database that can be used for storing statistics data
  * PostgreSQL 11 or newer is required
  * 50 GB of dedicated disk space or more
* Optional: If you use the RDS integration, set up an appropriate IAM role that can be used to download logs and system metrics
  * You can also assign the required policy to an existing EC2 instance and its instance role
  * You will need the [collector IAM policy](/docs/install/amazon_rds/iam_policy)

### Step 1: Download the container image

The Docker image is made available to you through the container hosting service quay.io.

You will have received credentials (username and license key) by email from our sales team.

Use the provided credentials like this to access to the image:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`docker login -e="." -u="pganalyze+enterprise_customer" -p="REPLACE_ME" quay.io`}
</CodeBlock>

Note that this will add the login information to your current user's `.dockercfg` file - you will need this on every host where you'd like to access the image.

You should now be able to pull the pganalyze Enterprise Server Docker image:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`docker pull quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[version]`}
</CodeBlock>
Please note that `[version]` should be replaced with the version you are using. We recommend using [the latest release](/docs/enterprise/releases).


### Step 2: Setting environment variables

The Docker image uses environment variables that are passed in to determine how to access outside services, like PostgreSQL, LDAP and mail servers.

We recommend keeping the environment variables in the file `/etc/pganalyze.env`.

Here is an example `/etc/pganalyze.env` file to get you started:

<CodeBlock language="text">
{`DATABASE_URL=postgres://myusername:mypassword@example.com:5432/mydatabase
LICENSE_KEY=REPLACE_ME`}
</CodeBlock>

You can find the full explanation of all variables in the [settings documentation](/docs/enterprise/settings), for example the `MAILER_URL` setting which is required to activate email alerts.

### Step 3: Initialize database & verify installation

Run the Enterprise self check, to ensure the configuration is correct:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`docker run --env-file /etc/pganalyze.env quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[version] \
  rake enterprise:self_check`}
</CodeBlock>

```
Testing database connection... Success!
Testing Redis connection... Success!
Testing LDAP connection... Success!

All tests completed successfully!
```

In the case of an error this will give you a very verbose error message - please don't hesitate to [ask us about it](/contact/).

Assuming it succeeds, continue by initializing the database schema.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`docker run --env-file /etc/pganalyze.env quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[version] \
  rake db:structure:load`}
</CodeBlock>

If you get permission errors, you may need to create the extensions `btree_gist` and `pgcrypto` beforehand. A successful output looks like this:

```
Jul  2 07:15:16 aa84f55aceba syslog-ng[160]: syslog-ng starting up; version='3.13.2'
Jul  2 07:15:17 aa84f55aceba cron[180]: (CRON) INFO (pidfile fd = 3)
Jul  2 07:15:17 aa84f55aceba cron[180]: (CRON) INFO (Running @reboot jobs)
 set_config
------------

(1 row)

Jul  2 07:15:22 aa84f55aceba syslog-ng[160]: syslog-ng shutting down; version='3.13.2'
```

### Step 4: Create initial admin user

Create the initial user:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`docker run --env-file /etc/pganalyze.env quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[version] \
  rake db:seed`}
</CodeBlock>

Make sure to note down the default user email and password:

```
Jul  2 07:15:29 8bc5a4c0e6b6 syslog-ng[150]: syslog-ng starting up; version='3.13.2'
Jul  2 07:15:30 8bc5a4c0e6b6 cron[167]: (CRON) INFO (pidfile fd = 3)
Jul  2 07:15:30 8bc5a4c0e6b6 cron[167]: (CRON) INFO (Running @reboot jobs)

Jul  2 07:15:35 8bc5a4c0e6b6 syslog-ng[150]: syslog-ng shutting down; version='3.13.2'
```

### Step 5: Start web server and log in to pganalyze

You can now start the Docker image in the background using this command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`docker run -d --name pganalyze --env-file /etc/pganalyze.env -p 8080:5000 \
  quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[version]`}
</CodeBlock>

This will make the web interface accessible on the server's address, on port 8080. You should see a site like this when you open your web browser for that address and port:

![](login.png)

Now you can log in to the pganalyze interface using the generated credentials you've seen earlier when setting up the database. If successful you should see this screen:

![](create_organization.png)

If authentication does not work, or you see an error message, please check the container's logs using `docker logs`.

Choose an organization name of your choice (typically your company name), and then click "Add Server" on the next screen.

### Step 6: Preparing your PostgreSQL database for monitoring

Before you can add a database to the pganalyze installation, you'll need to enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension on it.

This extension is bundled with PostgreSQL and allows you detailed query monitoring. Its overhead on the database system is minimal, and it is required to use pganalyze.

Please see [self-hosted systems](/docs/install/01_enabling_pg_stat_statements) or [Amazon RDS](/docs/install/amazon_rds/00_overview) instructions on how to add it to your database.

In addition you will need to either use the database superuser (usually "postgres") to give pganalyze access to your database, or create a special [restricted monitoring user](/docs/install/amazon_rds/02_create_monitoring_user).

You don't need to run anything else on your database server - the pganalyze container will connect to your database at regular intervals to gather information from PostgreSQL's statistics tables.

### Step 7: Add your first database to pganalyze

You can now either:

1. Use the integrated collector in the Enterprise Server image (works best for Amazon RDS / Aurora)
2. Use a [separate collector installation](/docs/enterprise/setup/separate-collector-install) (recommended all other environments)

To do so, follow the instructions shown in pganalyze on the "Add Server" page.

After adding a database server through one of these methods, initially, until sufficient information is available, your screen will look like this:

![](server_empty.png)

You can check whether any information has been received by clicking the "Server Settings" link in the left navigation, and scrolling down to the "Debug Info" section:

![](debug_info_no_data.png)

Once data is coming in successfully, the "Debug Info" looks like this:

![](debug_info_with_data.png)

**Important:** Be aware that some graphs need at least a few hours worth of data and might not work properly before.

### Next steps

To learn more about adding additional team members, see [Account Management](/docs/accounts).

We also recommend changing both the email and password of the admin user initially created (you can do so by clicking on "Admin" in the lower left of the screen).

Additionally, you can review [all configuration settings](/docs/enterprise/settings) for the Enterprise container.

## Appendix: How to apply config changes

When you make changes to the pganalyze container configuration in `/etc/pganalye.env`, make sure to fully restart the container afterwards, like this:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`docker stop pganalyze
docker rm pganalyze
docker run -d --name pganalyze --env-file /etc/pganalyze.env -p 8080:5000 \
  quay.io/pganalyze/enterprise:[version]`}
</CodeBlock>
