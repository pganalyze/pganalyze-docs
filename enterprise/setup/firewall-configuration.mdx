When hosting pganalyze Enterprise Server within your own environment, you may need to adjust firewall settings to allow the various components to communicate. The following
outbound ports need to be open:

## pganalyze Enterprise Docker VM
  * ***.quay.io**, Ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) - Optionally, reference specific hostnames listed on [Firewall changes for container image pulls 2024/2025](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7084334) if necessary
  * **enterprise-license-check.pganalyze.com**, Port 443 (HTTPS) - Used for pganalyze Enterprise Server license check every 24 hours

## pganalyze Collector VM (typically the PostgreSQL server)
  * **packages.pganalyze.com**, Port 443 (HTTPS) - To download pganalyze collector packages
  * pganalyze Enterprise VM, Port 8080 - used by the pganalyze collector to send information to the internal pganalyze installation
  * PostgreSQL server, Port 5432 (or custom port) - used by the pganalyze collector to connect to the PostgreSQL database server to collect metrics

We highly recommend that the pganalyze collector is installed on the same VM as the PostgreSQL database server when possible. However, regardless of where the collector is installed, it 
needs to be able to connect to the pganalyze Enterprise VM on port 8080.
