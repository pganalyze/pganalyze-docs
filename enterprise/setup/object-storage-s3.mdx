## 1. Pre-requisites

pganalyze Enterprise Server currently requires the following when storing statistics snapshots and logs in Amazon S3:

- An Amazon S3 bucket to be used for temporary statistics data
- An Amazon S3 bucket to be used for log data (this is where encrypted log data will be stored)
- An Amazon KMS key to be used for log text encryption (you can find KMS under "Encryption Keys" in the IAM console)
- An Amazon IAM user that can access the S3 bucket and KMS key (we need the keys in the next steps)

The setup for these should be straightforward - we recommend choosing a region thats close to your database servers, but latency shouldn't be too much of an issue in general.

If you are not using Amazon Web Services, the [local storage setup](/docs/enterprise/log-insights-local) might be a better fit.

## 2. Setup IAM user

The pganalyze Docker container needs to have authenticated access to the S3 bucket and KMS key. You can create a regular user, save the access keys, and then assign the following policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::mydb-logs"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::mydb-logs/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1440353940000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::mydb-snapshots/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::mydb-snapshots"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

You will also need to assign this IAM user as a "Key User" to the KMS key.

## 3. Configuration on pganalyze Docker container

You will need to add the following configuration to the Docker container:

```sh
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_SNAPSHOTS_BUCKET=mydb-snapshots
AWS_S3_LOGS_BUCKET=mydb-logs
AWS_KMS_LOGS_CMK=...
```

By default pganalyze will attempt IAM authentication using the AWS metadata service / instance roles. If you want to use static keys you can set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variables.

The `AWS_KMS_LOGS_CMK` is the "ARN" thats listed on the encryption key.

After a pganalyze container restart, you can now use Log Insights and Automated EXPLAIN, as well as [install the collector separately](/docs/enterprise/setup/separate-collector-install) (if desired).
