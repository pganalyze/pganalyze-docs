## Log Insights setup

Using pganalyze Enterprise Edition with Log Insights and Automated EXPLAIN requires some additional configuration:

* For Amazon RDS and Aurora you can turn on the Log Insights flag on your servers in the settings page, or run the collector separately
* For self-managed servers, you can either [add the pg_read_file helper](/docs/install/troubleshooting/pg_read_file_helper) and then turn on the Log Insights flag on the server settings page, or run the collector separately
* For all other providers you need to run the collector separately

For running the collector separately, see [separate collector installation](/docs/enterprise/setup/separate-collector-install)

You should then see data flow into the dashboard correctly. To troubleshoopt we recommend running a collector test. When using the collector inside the pganalyze Enterprise Server image, you can do so from the Server Settings page ("Collector Configuration Test").
