In order for a tracing span created by the pganalyze collector to correctly
attach to the existing tracing on the application side, the query needs to have
a `traceparent` query tag, as defined in the [W3 Trace Context specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#traceparent-header).

Query tags are key-value pairs appended to SQL statements as query comments.
The pganalyze collector currently supports the following three formats to read
a `traceparent` tag:

* [sqlcommenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/) format: `key='value'`
* sqlcommenter format without single quotes: `key=value`
* [marginalia](https://github.com/basecamp/marginalia) format: `key:value`

## Add traceparent with Go

### Prerequisite

Set up OpenTelemetry SDK with your application. Read the
[OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/getting-started/)
for details.

### `database/sql`

The easiest way to add a query tag with Go is to use a drop-in replacement for
go's `database/sql` library, provided by [sqlcommenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/go/database_sql/).

That library provides an option `EnableTraceparent`: you can enable it to append
a traceparent query tag as a query comment. Please note that this is only
available when you're using OpenTelemetry for your application's tracing too, as
it is going to reference the context and the trace context should be filled by
the application side already.

## Add traceparent with Ruby

### Prerequisite

Set up OpenTelemetry SDK with your application. Read the
[OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/ruby/getting-started/)
for details.

### Rails 7+

Rails 7 introduced [Active Record Query Logs](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryLogs.html)
which automatically appends comments (query tags) to SQL queries.
You can enable this via Rails configuration in `config/application.rb` or an
initializer:

```ruby
config.active_record.query_log_tags_enabled = true
```

By default, this doesn't have a traceparent query tag, so you'll need to add it
manually. New comment tags can be defined by adding them in a `Hash` to the tags
`Array`.
You can append the traceparent tag like the following:

```ruby
config.active_record.query_log_tags = [
  :application,
  :controller,
  :action,
  :job,
  {
    traceparent: -> () {
      current_span = ::OpenTelemetry::Trace.current_span
      return if current_span == ::OpenTelemetry::Trace::Span::INVALID

      span_context = current_span.context
      trace_flag   = span_context.trace_flags.sampled? ? '01' : '00'
      format(
        '00-%<trace_id>s-%<span_id>s-%<trace_flags>.2d',
        trace_id: span_context.hex_trace_id,
        span_id: span_context.hex_span_id,
        trace_flags: trace_flag
      )
    }
  }
]
```

With above configuration, queries will have the comments like the following:

```sql
SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles" /*application='myblog',action='index',controller='articles',traceparent='00-953c157ad37a81d94fe83bb95cfc8add-3cf784b99bd43910-01'*/
```

### Marginalia

If you are using Rails 6 and below, you can attach SQL comments using the
[marginalia](https://github.com/basecamp/marginalia) gem.

You can define a transparent tag in the initializer
(e.g. `config/initializers/marginalia.rb`):

```ruby
module Marginalia
  module Comment
    def self.traceparent
      current_span = ::OpenTelemetry::Trace.current_span
      return if current_span == ::OpenTelemetry::Trace::Span::INVALID

      span_context = current_span.context
      trace_flag   = span_context.trace_flags.sampled? ? '01' : '00'
      format(
        '00-%<trace_id>s-%<span_id>s-%<trace_flags>.2d',
        trace_id: span_context.hex_trace_id,
        span_id: span_context.hex_span_id,
        trace_flags: trace_flag
      )
    end
  end
end

Marginalia::Comment.components = [:application, :controller, :action, :job, :traceparent]
```

## Add traceparent with Python

### Prerequisite

Set up OpenTelemetry SDK with your application. Read the
[OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/getting-started/)
for details.

In Python, you can use an [automatic instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/automatic/)
using a Python agent. This approach offers less control over what to instrument,
including the option to enable [sqlcommenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/)
at the moment.
To enable sqlcommenter, you will need to use a manual instrumentation. This will
also attach the appropriate traceparent as a query comment automatically.

### Django

You can enable sqlcommenter in Django by passing `is_sql_commentor_enabled=True`:

```python
DjangoInstrumentor().instrument(is_sql_commentor_enabled=True)
```

### Flask

For Flask application, you can enable sqlcommenter by passing `enable_commenter=True`:

```python
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument(enable_commenter=True, commenter_options={})
```

### SQLAlchemy, Psycopg

In addition to framework-level settings, you can also enable sqlcommenter at the
ORM level (SQLAlchemy) or the database driver level (Psycopg).

```python
SQLAlchemyInstrumentor().instrument(enable_commenter=True, commenter_options={})

Psycopg2Instrumentor().instrument(enable_commenter=True, commenter_options={})
```

When performing manual instrumentation, these instrumentations won't be enabled
automatically. To have better tracing spans around the queries, it is
recommended to enable instrumentations related to ORMs and/or database drivers.

## Add pganalyze tracestate (optional)

When the Postgres database has limited precision in its `log_line_prefix`
timestamp, timing data of spans exported by pganalyze may not line up with other
spans exported by the application.
This issue will typically occur with Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora, which
currently do not allow changing the timestamp precision of the
`log_line_prefix` (it's always set to`%t:%r:%u@%d:[%p]:t`).

To workaround this, you can use the `pganalyze` tracestate and pass the query
start time with it. You can learn more about the tracestate in OpenTelemetry
document [TraceState](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#tracestate) section.

The pganalyze tracestate should use the `pganalyze` key, with the value being a
semicolon separated list of key-value pairs such as:

```
pganalyze=key1:value1;key2:value2
```

Currently, `t` is the only supported key-value pair to specify the query start
time.

| key | value |
|-----|-------|
| t   | The start time of query. Unix time in seconds, with decimals to specify precision down to nano seconds |


### Rails 7+

Assuming that you already have the traceparent set up with Rails 7+, you can
append the tracestate tag like the following:

```ruby
config.active_record.query_log_tags = [
  :application,
  :controller,
  :action,
  :job,
  {
    traceparent: -> () {
      current_span = ::OpenTelemetry::Trace.current_span
      return if current_span == ::OpenTelemetry::Trace::Span::INVALID

      span_context = current_span.context
      trace_flag   = span_context.trace_flags.sampled? ? '01' : '00'
      format(
        '00-%<trace_id>s-%<span_id>s-%<trace_flags>.2d',
        trace_id: span_context.hex_trace_id,
        span_id: span_context.hex_span_id,
        trace_flags: trace_flag
      )
    },
    tracestate: -> () {
      current_span = ::OpenTelemetry::Trace.current_span
      return if current_span == ::OpenTelemetry::Trace::Span::INVALID

      tracestate = current_span.context.tracestate.set_value('pganalyze', "t:#{Time.now.utc.to_f}")
      tracestate.to_s
    }
  }
]
```

### Marginalia

Assuming that you already have the traceparent set up with Marginalia, you can
append the tracestate tag like the following:


```ruby
module Marginalia
  module Comment
    def self.traceparent
      current_span = ::OpenTelemetry::Trace.current_span
      return if current_span == ::OpenTelemetry::Trace::Span::INVALID

      span_context = current_span.context
      trace_flag   = span_context.trace_flags.sampled? ? '01' : '00'
      format(
        '00-%<trace_id>s-%<span_id>s-%<trace_flags>.2d',
        trace_id: span_context.hex_trace_id,
        span_id: span_context.hex_span_id,
        trace_flags: trace_flag
      )
    end

    def self.tracestate
      current_span = ::OpenTelemetry::Trace.current_span
      return if current_span == ::OpenTelemetry::Trace::Span::INVALID

      tracestate = current_span.context.tracestate.set_value('pganalyze', "t:#{Time.now.utc.to_f}")
      tracestate.to_s
    end
  end
end

Marginalia::Comment.components = [:application, :controller, :action, :job, :traceparent, :tracestate]
```
