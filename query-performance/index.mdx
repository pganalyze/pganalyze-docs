The Query Performance page in pganalyze contains information about query
statistics, using the data from the `pg_stat_statements` view.

The query statistic data is collected every minute and is sent to pganalyze
every 10 minutes.

## Database Queries

![Database query performance](query_performance.png)

Once you specify a database, you can see statistics for queries in that
database. The chart displays the overall query latency.

In the table below the chart, you can find a list of all queries in the
database (subject to [pg_stat_statements.max](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-CONFIG-PARAMS)).
The list is sorted by the percentage of all runtime by default. You can search
this list by part of the query text, or the name of the Postgres roles executing
the query.

### How percentiles are calculated

Our percentile calculations use weighted averages of execution times, derived
from total times and call frequencies, rather than direct raw execution times.
This streamlined approach, however, might not highlight outliers as effectively.

For example, with query statistics over 10 minutes:

* query1: total time 8,000ms for 10 calls, averaging 800ms
* query2: total time 8,000ms for 20 calls, averaging 400ms
* query3: total time 9,000ms for 30 calls, averaging 300ms
* query4: total time 8,000ms for 40 calls, averaging 200ms

This process generates a dataset like `[200ms (40 times), 300ms (30 times), 400ms (20 times), 800ms (10 times)]`.
The median is 300ms, but this method might not fully represent outliers. For
instance, if query1 had two exceptionally slow runs (2,000ms each), the true
99th percentile might be 2,000ms, not 800ms as our averaged data would suggest.

## Query details

### Overview

The SQL Statement you can see here is a normalized query and all values are
replaced by placeholders, such as `$1`.

#### Query can be truncated

When the query exceeds the current size limit set by `track_activity_query_size`,
it will be shown as `<truncated query>`. If you encounter this frequently,
consider increasing this limit. Be aware that increasing the limit may result in
Postgres consuming more memory.

### Index Advisor

You can see the list of scans executed by this query here. A scan is how a query
reads data from a table (either through an index or as a sequential scan). For
each scan, the Index Advisor will show if there are any recommended changes.

### Query Samples

Shows the list of query samples collected in the last 24 hours, regardless of
the selected time range. This is only available when Log Insights is integrated
and the query execution time exceeds either `log_min_duration_statement`
or `auto_explain.log_min_duration`.

### EXPLAIN Plans

Shows the list of EXPLAIN plans collected in the last 7 days, regardless of the
selected time range, up to 30 plans. This is only available when [Automated EXPLAIN](/docs/explain/setup)
is integrated and the query execution time exceeds `auto_explain.log_min_duration`.

### Query Tags

Shows the list of query tags collected in the last 7 days, regardless of the
selected time range. See [Query Tags](/docs/query-performance/query-tags)
section for more detail.

### Log Entries

Shows up to 100 log entries, up to the selected time range's "to" time (or
the current time if the selected time range is something like Last 24 hours).
