The Query Performance page in pganalyze contains information about query
statistics, using the data from the `pg_stat_statements` view.

The query statistic data is collected every one minute and is sent to pganalyze
every 10 minutes.

## Database Queries

![Database query performance](query_performance.png)

Once you specify the database of the server, you can see the statistic of
database queries. The chart helps you to find out the overall query latency.

TODO: clarify how we calculate percentile

In the table below the chart, you can find the list of all queries of the
database, default sorted by the percent of all runtime. You can search this by
a part of (or the full text of) the query in a normalized shape, or a name of
Postgres roles.

## Query details

### Overview

The SQL Statement you can see here is a normalized query and all values are
replaced by placeholders, such as `$1`.

#### Query can be truncated

When the query is exceeding the current size limit set by `track_activity_query_size`,
it will be shown as `<truncated query>`. If you encounter this frequently,
consider increasing this limit. Be aware that increasing the limit may result in
Postgres consuming more memory.

### Index Advisor

You can see the list of scans happened within this query here. Within the each
scan, it'll show if there is any recommended changes or not.

### Query Samples

Show the list of query samples collected in the last 24 hours, regardless of the
selected time range. This is only available when Log Insights is integrated, as
well as when the query execution time exceeds either `log_min_duration_statement`
or `auto_explain.log_min_duration`.

### EXPLAIN Plans

Show the list of EXPLAIN plans collected in the last 7 days, regardless of the
selected time range, up to 30 plans. This is only available when Automatic
Explain is integrated (prerequisites: Log Insights has to be integrated), as
well as when the query execution time exceeds `auto_explain.log_min_duration`.

### Query Tags

Show the list of query tags collected in the last 7 days, regardless of the
selected time range. See [Query Tags](/docs/query-performance/query-tags)
section for more detail.

### Log Entries

Show the up to 100 log entries, up to the selected time range's "to" time (or
the current time if the selected time range is something like Last 24 hours).
