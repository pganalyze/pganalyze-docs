Query tags are key-value pairs of runtime information of a query that you can
add to the SQL statements as a query comment. The runtime information can be a
name of the background job that is running the query, or a trace ID.

Query tags help to find out where the query is coming from, or also help to find
the corresponding query of the specific background job or a slow query.

There are several tools to help you add query tags to your query. For instance,
you can use the [sqlcommenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/) to
augment SQL statements before execution, with comments containing information
about the code that caused its execution. Rails 7+ has a built-in feature called
[Query Logs](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryLogs.html)
that allows you to add tags like `controller` and `action` to the query so that
you can identify which controller and action the query was called from.

In pganalyze, you can see tags of a query in the "Query Tags" tab in the
individual query page.

This query tag is also used in the OpenTelemetry integration to specify the
traceparent and tracestate, you can learn more in the
[traceparent section of the OpenTelemetry integration docs](/docs/opentelemetry/traceparent).

## Supported formats

Currently, the pganalyze collector supports the following Query Tags formats:

* [sqlcommenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/) format: `key='value'`
  * `SELECT 1 /* key1='value1',key2='value2' */`
* [sqlcommenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/) format without single quotes: `key=value`
  * `SELECT 1 /* key1=value1, key2=value2 */`
* [marginalia](https://github.com/basecamp/marginalia) format: `key:value`
  * `SELECT 1 /* key1:value1, key2:value2 */`

The query comments can be appended either before or after the query.


## Query Tags tab

In the individual query detail page, you can find query tags in the header of
the page, as well as in the "Query Tags" tab.
