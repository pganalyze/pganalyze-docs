## Getting Started

Workbooks provide a unified interface and workflow for optimizing slow Postgres queries.

The Workbooks feature lets you organize related `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
outputs and share them easily and securely with your team. Each workbook contains a
baseline query documenting a query's current performance, and one or more variants.

Variants are modifications to the original query that aim to optimize it by changing planner
settings, adding a `pg_hint_plan` hint, or rewriting the query. You can analyze variants
with clear visibility into changes and their effects on performance, using key metrics
such as cost estimates, runtime, I/O read time, estimated vs actual rows.

You can also run a diff between two query plans using the Compare Plans feature, helping
you visualize and compare execution plans side-by-side. This feature helps debug whether
differences in performance are due to plan shape or other factors like high I/O or rows processed.

Different parameter values (or different constant values) can lead to varying performance or even
a different plan for a specific query. The parameter sets feature makes it easy to test performance
for different bind parameter values across the baseline and variants, making sure that optimizing
for one user's experience does not slow down other cases.

Workbooks automatically convert positional parameters to named parameters, e.g. turning
`user_id = $1` into `user_id = $user_id`. This makes it easy to test rewrites of a query, or test
individual portions of a query.

## How to enable Workbooks

### New role and permissions

Workbooks utilize a separate user permission, [Create Workbooks](/docs/accounts/permissions#create-workbooks).
This permission allows users to create workbooks and to use all associated
Workbooks features.

Only users with the `Admin (All Servers)` role (assigned to the initial organization owner by default)
or the `View & Create Workbooks (All Servers)` role (not assigned to anyone by default),
get this permission assigned automatically.

Users without the permission are able to view existing workbooks, including parameter
information, but cannot create new workbooks, variants, or use the collector workflow.

### Set up the collector to run EXPLAIN ANALYZE for you

Workbooks streamline the process of gathering query plans through either automatic collector-based
or manual workflows.

If set up, the collector can run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` queries automatically for you, saving time and effort. To use this
functionality, ensure you're running collector [version 0.64.0](/docs/collector/upgrading) or later and follow the
[documentation for setting up the collector workflow](/docs/workbooks/collector-workflow).

We also recommend reviewing the [Security & Privacy Considerations](/docs/workbooks/security-privacy)
to assess whether the collector workflow is a good fit for a given production server.

If you prefer not to use the automatic collection, you can alternatively use the manual workflow that
requires copy and pasting the results of `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` commands from an active database
connection.

Both automatic and manual workflows are available to all users with the Create Workbooks permission.

## Query Advisor

For customers on the Scale and Enterprise plans, [Query Advisor](/docs/query-advisor) automatically analyzes query plans to detect
optimization opportunities and suggests specific query rewrites or planner hints. Query Advisor
insights integrate seamlessly with Workbooks, providing a complete workflow from automated
detection to systematic testing and validation of optimizations.

## Limitations

* Workbooks are currently not suited for optimizing queries invoked inside of functions
* Workbooks are currently not suited for testing different index choices by doing CREATE INDEX
* Data modification (DML) queries are not supported
* All query executions are limited to 60 seconds (this limit will be configurable in the future)
* The Collector Workflow requires the use of a function not owned by superuser
  * If your database provider does not allow creating separate roles, you cannot use the Collector Workflow
