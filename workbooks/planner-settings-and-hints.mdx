You can test optimizing queries by creating variants. In the Rewrite Query page
of the new variant creation flow, you can not only rewrite a query, but also
tweak the planner settings and planner hints. Each allows you to influence the
query planner's decisions. Planner hints offer fine-grained control but requires
a module to be loaded (see below).

## Editing Planner Settings

In the Edit Planner Settings modal, you can tweak [the configuration parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html)
that influence the query plan chosen by the query optimizer.
These settings will be applied only to the current variant.

For instance, you can set `enable_nestloop` to `off` to ensure that nested loop
joins will not be used in this variant.
You can only save the setting if its value differs from the default.
For example, for `enable_nestloop`, the default value is `on`: you can only set
it to `off`.

## Editing Planner Hints

The Edit Planner Hints modal helps you add `pg_hint_plan` hinting phrases to the
query. Pick a hint to add, then specify the value enclosed in parentheses.

**Note:** Editing planner hints is only available when the database is loading
the `pg_hint_plan` module in `shared_preload_libraries`. Check the [Enabling pg_hint_plan](/docs/workbooks/enabling_pg_hint_plan)
page for how to enable `pg_hint_plan`.

When saving the hint, it is validated against the current query. It checks any
syntax errors, whether it will be used (e.g., if the hint specifies a table name
that does not exist in the query, it will be considered unused), or if it is
redundant or conflicts with existing hints.

When a new hint is saved, the query is updated with the hinting phrases. In
contrast, saving a new planner setting does not update the current query, but
the changes are reflected in the sidebar.
