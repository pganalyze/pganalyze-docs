import { explainAnalyzeHelper } from '../components/helperSQL'

The Collector Workflow in Workbooks optionally allows users with the [Tune Queries permission](/docs/accounts/permissions#tune-queries)
to execute arbitrary EXPLAIN ANALYZE commands directly from the pganalyze user interface. This eliminates
the need for manual copying and pasting of command outputs. These EXPLAIN ANALYZE commands are executed
through the pganalyze collector.

In order to set up the Collector Workflow you must create the special `pganalyze_explain`
role on your database server, as well as the `pganalyze.explain_analyze` helper function
in each database where this feature should be active.

We recommend reading about [Security & Privacy](security-privacy) before setting up the Collector Workflow.

## Creating the pganalyze_explain role

As an additional layer of security, we require creating a separate role in Postgres
that is used to execute `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statements from pganalyze. This role should
not have any password assigned (and not allow login), instead it is only utilized
by calling a special helper function owned by the role.

First, start by creating the new role:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`CREATE ROLE pganalyze_explain;`}
</CodeBlock>

Then, either use GRANT statements for individual tables ([described separately](#individual-grant-statements-instead-of-pg_read_all_data)), or assign the
`pg_read_all_data` role to the `pganalyze_explain` role:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`GRANT pg_read_all_data TO pganalyze_explain;`}
</CodeBlock>

The special `pg_read_all_data` role lets the `pganalyze_explain` user read the data of
all tables on the database server.

Note that access to the role is restricted through use of a helper
function, which only returns the results of the EXPLAIN ANALYZE command, not the original
table data, with [some exceptions](security-privacy#data-privacy-considerations).

## Setting up the pganalyze.explain_analyze helper

In each database where you would like to enable the Collector Workflow, you need to create
the following helper function. This needs to be executed as the `pganalyze_explain` user,
to ensure the `SECURITY DEFINER` privilege is correctly assigned.

First, ensure the `pganalyze` schema exists, temporarily allow the `pganalyze_explain`
user to create functions in it, and switch roles:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS pganalyze;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA pganalyze TO pganalyze;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA pganalyze TO pganalyze_explain;
SET ROLE pganalyze_explain;`}
</CodeBlock>

Then, create the function:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{explainAnalyzeHelper}
</CodeBlock>

To complete the setup, reset the role, and revoke the creation privilege again:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`RESET ROLE;
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA pganalyze FROM pganalyze_explain;`}
</CodeBlock>
<br/>

## Resolving search_path issues
The `explain_analyze` function is created with `SECURITY DEFINER`, which means it will run with the privileges of the `pganalyze_explain` role,
but using the `search_path` of the role that calls it. This will be the role that the pganalyze-collector uses to connect to the database. If
this role has a different `search_path` than the role(s) that are running queries, the function may return `object not found` errors when trying to
run a query variant using the collector workflow.

To resolve the `search_path` issues, set the `search_path` on the function to ensure that it always uses the correct schemas regardless of what role
calls the function. Run the following `ALTER` command, ensuring that you replace `my_app_schema` with the schema(s) that contains your application 
tables and functions.

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`ALTER FUNCTION pganalyze.explain_analyze SET search_path = my_app_schema, public;`}
</CodeBlock>
<br/>

 
## Revoking access for dblink & other problematic functions

Certain functions in Postgres can be problematic if permitted to be called. It is your
responsibility to block use of these functions from the `pganalyze_explain` user.

An example of this is [dblink](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/dblink.html), which,
if set up on a given database, can allow copying data to a remote Postgres server, potentially
letting someone with access to the `pganalyze_explain` user exfiltrate data.

By default `dblink` can be used by any user in the system, whether they are superuser or not.

As a general best practice, and to avoid granting access to the `pganalyze_explain` user,
we recommend explicitly revoking the use of `dblink` from `PUBLIC`:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION dblink(text, text) FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION dblink(text, text, bool) FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION dblink_connect(text) FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION dblink_connect(text, text) FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION dblink_exec(text, text) FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION dblink_exec(text, text, bool) FROM PUBLIC;`}
</CodeBlock>

Note that if you have any non-superuser users utilizing `dblink`, you will need to explicitly
grant them access to these functions instead.

## Individual GRANT statements instead of pg_read_all_data

Whilst requiring more setup effort, you can also utilize `GRANT` to allow access to individual tables (or even individual columns),
instead of using `pg_read_all_data` as described earlier.

For example, to grant access to all columns in table `test`, and only some columns in table `restricted`, you can run the following `GRANT` statements:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`GRANT SELECT ON test TO pganalyze_explain;
GRANT SELECT (col1, col2) ON restricted TO pganalyze_explain;`}
</CodeBlock>

Or alternatively you can grant access to all tables in a schema:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA myschema TO pganalyze_explain;`}
</CodeBlock>

Note this will not grant privileges to tables in the schema that are newly created after the `GRANT` statement was executed.

For most systems we recommend utilizing the `pg_read_all_data` role to avoid having to managing individual `GRANT` statements.

## Deactivating the Collector Workflow

In order to deactivate the collector workflow, you will first need to drop the helper function on each database:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`DROP FUNCTION pganalyze.explain_analyze(query text, params text[], param_types text[], analyze_flags text[]);`}
</CodeBlock>

And then you can optionally drop the role as well:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`DROP ROLE pganalyze_explain;`}
</CodeBlock>
