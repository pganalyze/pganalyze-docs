**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: autovacuum launcher started
```

**Explanation:**

A common log event during server startup, or when autovacuum was disabled and then
later re-enabled.

The autovacuum launcher is responsible for scheduling autovacuum tasks, and needs to
be running in order for tables to get automatic VACUUM runs.

Note that this log message has been hidden
[starting in Postgres 10](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=6ec4c8584c45ee784a95e02c40bb643430dee32a)
due to it not being of much significance.
