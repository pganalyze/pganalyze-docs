**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
FATAL: terminating autovacuum process due to administrator command
```

```
LOG: autovacuum launcher shutting down
```

**Explanation:**

These log messages appear when the autovacuum launcher is shutting down,
or gets terminated.

Note that the `FATAL` message only occurs when an unexpected action is taken,
e.g. by an administrator running `pg_terminate_backend` on the autovacuum
launcher process.

The `LOG` message is not of much significance, and has been hidden
[starting in Postgres 10](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=6ec4c8584c45ee784a95e02c40bb643430dee32a).

**Recommended Action:**

For the `LOG` message no action is necessary, as you would usually see it during
server shutdown.

If you see either of these messages outside the shutdown process it is worth
verifying whether the autovacuum launcher is still running, either by
checking the operating system's process list, or by checking `pg_stat_activity`
like this in Postgres 10+:

```
postgres=# SELECT pid, backend_start FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE backend_type = 'autovacuum launcher';
 pid |         backend_start
