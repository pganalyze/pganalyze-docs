**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: skipping analyze of "pgbench_tellers" --- lock not available
```

**Explanation:**

This event indicates that an ANALYZE operation couldn't start because it couldn't
acquire the required lock, an ShareUpdateExclusiveLock, on the table.

**Recommended Action:**

Review all current lock holders on the table by running the following:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE relation = 'mytable'::regclass;
```

This will return something like this:

```
 locktype | database | relation | page | tuple | virtualxid | transactionid | classid | objid | objsubid | virtualtransaction | pid  |        mode         | granted | fastpath
----------+----------+----------+------+-------+------------+---------------+---------+-------+----------+--------------------+------+---------------------+---------+----------
 relation |  1691898 |  1693426 |      |       |            |               |         |       |          | 3/22886            | 3502 | AccessExclusiveLock | t       | f
(1 row)
```

In this case you can see that there is a granted AccessExclusiveLock that prevents
ANALYZE from running.

The locks that are relevant and can block ANALYZE:

* ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
* ShareLock
* ShareRowExclusiveLock
* ExclusiveLock
* AccessExclusiveLock

You will need to wait for the lock to be available, or cancel the operation
running that holds the lock (see `pid` field) for ANALYZE to run.
