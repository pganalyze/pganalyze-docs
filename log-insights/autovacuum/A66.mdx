**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: automatic analyze of table "postgres.public.pgbench_branches" system usage: CPU 1.02s/2.08u sec elapsed 108.25 sec
```

**Explanation:**

This log event, similar to [A65 - Automatic vacuum of table completed](/docs/log-insights/autovacuum/A65), is controlled
by `log_autovacuum_min_duration`, as both are started by the autovacuum launcher.

ANALYZE is the process of updating table statistics, and whilst it often runs together with
VACUUM on a table, it can also run independently.

With ANALYZE its mostly CPU utilization that matters, which can also be seen by the smaller set of statistics
compared to automatic VACUUM statistics.

**Recommended Action:**

Typically no action is needed based on this event. Sometimes it makes sense to adjust
`autovacuum_analyze_threshold` or `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor`
to either reduce or increase the frequency of ANALYZE runs on specific tables.

That said, in most systems you will need to first spend time tuning the VACUUM settings
of autovacuum, as that usually has higher impact on system performance and query plans.
