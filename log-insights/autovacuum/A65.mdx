**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: automatic vacuum of table "mydb.public.vac_test": index scans: 1
 pages: 0 removed, 1 remain, 0 skipped due to pins, 0 skipped frozen
 tuples: 3 removed, 6 remain, 0 are dead but not yet removable
 buffer usage: 70 hits, 4 misses, 4 dirtied
 avg read rate: 62.877 MB/s, avg write rate: 62.877 MB/s
 system usage: CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec
```

**Explanation:**

This log event describes in detail the statistics of a completed autovacuum
on a table in the database. Note that this will only be logged when
`log_autovacuum_min_duration` is enabled on your database.

On most systems it is safe to simply turn on autovacuum logs for all durations,
which you can do by setting `log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0`.

Monitoring the log data for these events has benefits compared to other approaches
(e.g. sampling `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` / `pg_stat_acivity`) since even very
fast autovacuum runs will show up in the logs. The downside of course is that
you might see a lot of log events, so these are hard to parse through without
additional visualization.

One of the useful statistics in this log event, is that you can determine easily
how much I/O impact the autovacuum run had, based on the `avg read rate` and
`avg write rate`. This can be influenced by setting `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`
on the table, or for the database.

**Recommended Action:**

This log event on its own does not indicate anything bad, after all VACUUM is
an integral part of Postgres.

a lot of time.
