**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
FATAL: unsupported frontend protocol 65363.12345: server supports 1.0 to 3.0
```

**Explanation:**

This error message indicates that the client requested a Postgres FE/BE protocol version
that the server does not support.

The most likely explanation for this is programs accidentally connecting to the
Postgres port and not writing the correct protocol structure. You may also see
this when someone runs a port scanner against your database server.

You can find out the source IP of the broken connection from
[C20: Connection received](/docs/log-insights/connections/C20) when
`log_connections` is set to `on`.

**Recommended Action:**

No action necessary.
