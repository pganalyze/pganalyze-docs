**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: incomplete startup packet
```

**Explanation:**

This message occurs when PostgreSQL received a TCP connection, but the client
didn't complete sending the remaining data to actually start establishing
a Postgres connection.

Before PostgreSQL 12, where the behaviour was altered, this commonly occurred
when third-party tools did health checks on a PostgreSQL database by doing
a TCP connection and then immediately abandoning it again after the server
acknowledges the connection on the TCP level.

You can reproduce this by running `telnet localhost 5432` or `nc -vz localhost 5432`
which will result in this message being printed to the Postgres logs.

Starting with PostgreSQL 12 this message has been reduced to DEBUG1 level and
should no longer be visible for production systems.

**Recommended Action:**

No action is necessary - this log message can be safely ignored.
