**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: unterminated quoted string at or near "some string
STATEMENT: SELECT 'some string
```

**Explanation:**

The query can't be parsed by PostgreSQL since it contains a syntax error.

This is due to a quoted string that is missing the closing single quotation mark (i.e. `'some string`).

**Recommended Action:**

Fix the query syntax.
