**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR:  permission denied for schema my_schema at character 25
STATEMENT:  SELECT * FROM my_schema.table
```

**Explanation:**

This error occurs when the connected user is not allowed to access the relation
or object referenced by the query.

**Recommended Action:**

Review whether the query was produced by a misconfiguration of an application
(e.g. connecting with the wrong role), or a DBA accessing the wrong table
by accident.

If you make extensive use of the Postgres role system, and allow third party
access for some roles, this may also be a security relevant event, e.g. when
somebody tries to enumerate which tables can be accessed by a restricted user.
