**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
STATEMENT:  SELECT 1
```

**Explanation:**

This log event happens when a transaction fails due to a potentially unrelated error,
and you try to run another query in the failed transaction.

As a general rule, after an error, the transaction state needs to be cleaned up
using `ROLLBACK` before another query can be performed.

**Recommended Action:**

Usually this is caused by applications not handling errors in transactions correctly,
and keeping a transaction open instead of rolling it back.

This may have other unintended circumstances, so its highly recommended to fix
your application code to respond correctly to failures in transactions.
