**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: function x(integer) does not exist at character 8
HINT: No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.
STATEMENT: SELECT x(1);
```

**Explanation:**

The query tries to use a function that does not exist.

Note that function parameters in Postgres are data type specific, which means
that this can also often occur when the values passed to the function do not
match the required data types.

**Recommended Action:**

In case the wrong data types are passed in, add an explicit type cast.

Otherwise review if the function name is spelled correctly, and whether the
function has been created on the database.
