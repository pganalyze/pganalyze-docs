**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: INSERT has more expressions than target columns at character 341
STATEMENT: INSERT INTO x(y) VALUES (1, 2)
```

**Explanation:**

In the case of this log event, you specified the wrong number of columns in the
target list part of an INSERT statement, or passed in too many/not enough values per row.

For example, you might have sent this:

```
INSERT INTO my_table (column_a, column_b) VALUES (1,2,3), (4,5,6);
```

Instead of this:

```
INSERT INTO my_table (column_a, column_b, column_c) VALUES (1,2,3), (4,5,6);
```

This typically occurs due to a bug in your ORM-related logic, or when you manually
construct the SQL for INSERT statements.

**Recommended Action:**

Fix the syntax generated by your application code or ORM.
