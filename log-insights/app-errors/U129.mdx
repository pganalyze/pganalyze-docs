**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: cannot drop table x because other objects depend on it
DETAIL: view a depends on table x
HINT: Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
STATEMENT: DROP TABLE x
```

**Explanation:**

A request was sent to drop a specific database object (e.g. a table), but it
couldn't be completed, usually due to other objects still depending on it.

You will likely encounter this when using foreign keys and deleting tables in the
wrong order during regular development/staging operations, or when cleaning up
an old data model in production.

Sometimes this error message may also be encountered if you try to drop an
internal object in the Postgres system which can't be dropped.

**Recommended Action:**

Review the dependencies to and from the involved object carefully, and drop
them in the correct order.

Sometimes you may also utilize the `CASCADE` option to have this dependency
resolution by done automatically - but be careful, since cascading can also
lead to unintended objects being dropped.

Always use a transaction when using complex DDL like DROP with CASCADE, and verify
whether any problematic tables that are referenced e.g. via a foreign key constraint
were not affected negatively by the command, before running COMMIT.
