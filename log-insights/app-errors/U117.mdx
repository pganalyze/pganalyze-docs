**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: op ANY/ALL (array) requires array on right side at character 33
STATEMENT: SELECT * FROM x WHERE id = ANY ($1)
```

**Explanation:**

Usually you would see this log event when using parameterized queries together
with the ANY/ALL expression, like this:

```
SELECT * FROM x WHERE id = ANY ($1)
```

When `$1` has a value like `{1, 2}` this query will run correctly. However, when
you pass in a single value instead of an array (e.g. `1`) you will receive this
error notice.

**Recommended Action:**

Ensure your application code always generates an array value when passing data to
ANY/ALL, even for single value arrays.
