**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: unterminated quoted identifier at or near ""1" at character 8
STATEMENT: SELECT "1
```

**Explanation:**

The parser failed to read the query since it contains a syntax error.

You will see this log event when you forgot to add the closing double quotes for
an identifier in the query, e.g. when writing the name of a table in double quotes.

**Recommended Action:**

Rewrite the query to correctly close the double quotation marks.
