**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: column "abc" cannot be cast to type "date"
STATEMENT: SELECT abc::date FROM x
```

**Explanation:**

Your query is trying to cast the referenced column to a data type that is not
supported for the original data type.

Usually this would occur when you assume the original data type is something
different from what it actually is.

**Recommended Action:**

Fix the query to either use a different target type, or adjust the source column
to have the correct type.

In some cases you may also need multiple type casts to get your desired result.
