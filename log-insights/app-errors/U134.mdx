**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: no such savepoint
STATEMENT: ROLLBACK TO x
```

**Explanation:**

Savepoints are temporary points in a transaction that you can roll back to. They
are often utilized by ORM frameworks to implement nested transactions.

This error occurs when the specified savepoint can't be found, usually because
the parent transaction has already committed or rolled back.

If caused in regular operations together with an ORM, this may indicate a bug
in the ORM's state management.

**Recommended Action:**

When in development and the error is reproducible, review the exact SQL that was
issued before this savepoint to determine if this is caused by an ORM bug.

In production this is often harder to debug. It may help to add annotations to
the ROLLBACK TO query (using comments in the SQL), to understand which part of
your application has issued the command.
