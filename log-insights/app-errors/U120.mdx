**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: column "y" does not exist at character 8
STATEMENT: SELECT y FROM x

ERROR: column "y" of relation "x" does not exist
STATEMENT: ALTER TABLE x DROP COLUMN y;
```

**Explanation:**

The query is referencing a column that does not exist. You may have forgotten
to add a JOIN for the table/view that contains the column, or mistyped the column
name.

**Recommended Action:**

Fix your query to correctly reference the column. This error would typically
happen during development.
