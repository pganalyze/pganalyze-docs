**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: syntax error at or near "WHERE" at character 26"
STATEMENT: SELECT * FROM abc LIMIT 2 WHERE id=1
```

```
ERROR: syntax error at end of input
STATEMENT: SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1
```

**Explanation:**

This log event occurs when a query can't be parsed by the Postgres SQL parser. Typically
you would see this if someone mistyped a query in an interactive session.

It may also indicate a bug in application logic, especially when using handwritten SQL.

**Recommended Action:**

Fix the application code if this occurred outside of an interactive session.
