**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR:  invalid regular expression: quantifier operand invalid
STATEMENT:  SELECT regexp_replace('test', '<(?i:test)', '');
```

**Explanation:**

The regular expression is not valid. This usually happens when you made a typo
in the pattern, or if you've used a non-portable expression that doesn't work
in Postgres' regular expression parser.

PostgreSQL uses a variant of the POSIX regular expression engine, which is a superset
of the POSIX ERE form. Note that in particular that this is slightly different
than the widely used PCRE expression engine used in many server-side languages.

**Recommended Action:**

Fix the regular expression syntax.
