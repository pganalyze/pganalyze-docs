**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: column reference "z" is ambiguous at character 8
STATEMENT: SELECT z FROM x, y
```

**Explanation:**

This error occurs when the referenced column can't be resolved unambiguously. This
may occur when you have two tables that have columns with the same name.

In the example above, you would resolve this by adding an explicit table name
like this:

```
SELECT x.z FROM x, y
```

**Recommended Action:**

Fix your query to include the specific table or view that the column belongs to.
