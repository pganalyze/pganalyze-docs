This indicates a log event that could not be parsed by the pganalyze system.

Sometimes this occurs if log lines are received out of order, or if we don't support
a particular message yet.

Note that by default pganalyze redacts unknown log events, and the log
text will instead show as `[redacted]`. To see original texts you can omit `unidentified`
from the [log secret PII filter setting](/docs/collector/pii-filtering#log-secrets).

Please reach out to our support team to learn more why a log line is marked as
unknown.
