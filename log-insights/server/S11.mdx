**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: using stale statistics instead of current ones because stats collector is not responding
```

**Explanation:**

PostgreSQL maintains an internal UDP connection to the "stats collector" process
to write out per-table statistics and other internal metrics to the catalog
statistics tables.

Sometimes this connection can timeout, causing out of date statistics and
potentially other issues.

**Recommended Action:**

If you are seeing this as a one-off event, its typically no cause for concern.

However, if your server keeps showing this message, it might be necessary to
restart the Postgres server, since the "stats collector" process can get stuck
sometime, and it may cause problems if this persists for a significant amount
of time.
