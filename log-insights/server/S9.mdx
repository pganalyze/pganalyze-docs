**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: received SIGHUP, reloading configuration files
LOG: parameter "log_autovacuum_min_duration" changed to "0"
LOG: parameter "shared_preload_libraries" cannot be changed without restarting the server
LOG: configuration file "/var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.auto.conf" contains errors; unaffected changes were applied
```

**Explanation:**

This notice will be shown when the PostgreSQL server reloads, based on an operator request.

It will also log out any configuration parameters that may have been changed as part of this reload,
as well as any parameters that can't be changed because they require a restart.

**Recommended Action:**

Usually no action needs to be taken, as this was operator initiated.

In some cases you might want to verify that the config parameter change got applied,
and that you didn't accidentally make a typo in the config file, or tried to change
a config parameter that requires a full restart.
