**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: temporary file: path "base/pgsql_tmp/pgsql_tmp15967.0", size 200204288
STATEMENT: alter table pgbench_accounts add primary key (aid)
```

**Explanation:**

This log event is emitted when a temporary file was written, used as part of
normal operations, and then deleted again.

Commonly you would see this when a query could not allocate enough memory due to
`work_mem` restrictions, and had to use a file on disk to perform a sort or hash
operation.

Whether this log line is output or not, is determined by the `log_temp_files`
configuration setting.

By default this setting is disabled, but it can often make sense to simply set
this to `log_temp_files = 0`, which will log every temporary file that got written.

**Recommended Action:**

If you see this infrequently its usually not a problem, as its probably just an
analytics query that requires more data to be processed than could fit into RAM.

You may also see this a lot on a system that is designed for data warehousing,
where again this would be expected, and you may want to raise the `log_temp_files`
byte limit to reduce noise in the logs.

However, what can often happen on OLTP type systems that are not well tuned, is
that `work_mem` is configured way too low, and a lot of temporary files get created
for seemingly simple queries. You will also see I/O spikes in such situations,
since the temporary files need to be written to disk, read in again, etc.

In such cases it makes sense to raise `work_mem` based on these log messages,
and see whether they then disappear.
