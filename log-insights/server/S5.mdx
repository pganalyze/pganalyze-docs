LOG: server process (PID 123) was terminated by signal 9: Killed
```

**Explanation:**

This low-level out-of-memory (OOM) error occurs when Postgres is unable to allocate the memory required for a query to run, or any other internal operation to complete.

Note that depending on your operating system configuration you might also see the `terminated by signal 9: Killed` message, which can occur when the operating system's OOM killer process goes into action due to the whole system running out of memory.

Postgres is usually good at handling the explicit `out of memory` errors, so if you only have a momentary out of memory condition it will recover without a restart, and without crashing.

On the other hand if you get the OOM killer message that indicates a process was terminated by the kernel, Postgres will restart and then switch into [S3 - Server Start (Recovering)](/docs/log-insights/server/S3).

In general it is not advised to operate your database under a recurring OOM condition, as you may see unexpected error messages at any time, and processes are at risk of being terminated by the OS.

**Recommended Action:**

First of all, if you see this log event, it makes sense to capture the full message, including the last part that starts with `TopMemoryContext` and describes individual blocks in detail, for later analysis. This quite length memory statistics dump
can help to determine which part of Postgres was using RAM.

More generally, often out of memory occurs when operating a combination of too high `work_mem` together with a high number of active connections.

If you are getting frequent OOM errors a good first step is to reduce `work_mem`, which should improve stability at the cost of more sort/hash operations going to disk instead.

It also often makes sense to monitor the number of active connections at the time of the issue, e.g. through pganalyze's Connection Tracing feature.

Additionally, if you absolutely need more RAM to work with, you can evaluate reducing `shared_buffers` to provide more available RAM for memory directly used by connections. This should be done carefully, and whilst actively watching Buffer Cache Hit Ratio statistics.
