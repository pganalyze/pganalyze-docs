**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: worker process: parallel worker for PID 30491 (PID 31458) exited with exit code 1
DETAIL: Failed process was running: SELECT 1
LOG: worker process: logical replication launcher (PID 17443) was terminated by signal 9
```

**Explanation:**

This event describes the case where a child process, e.g. a parallel worker, was spawned,
and that process has exited. In some cases you will see `exited with exit code 0`, which
indicates a successful shutdown as part of normal operations.

Sometimes however you will see exit codes other than 0, or worker processes shutting
down due to signals they have received.

In such cases a bit more caution is advised, as this may indicate an event that requires
operator intervention.

**Recommended Action:**

First verify which kind of process exited (e.g. parallel worker), and then determine the
cause of the exit.

Whilst this particular log message tells you the exit code or signal, you sometimes have
to look at the log for the mentioned PID to get more details, as it may show the specific
error that caused the process to exit.
