This error indicates that you were passing data to a column that is too large
to be held by its data type, usually a `character` or `character varying` column
with a specified length limit.

Depending on how your application handles this, you may loose data in such cases,
unless your application saves the data that couldn't be stored elsewhere.

This error can often go unnoticed when testing in development or staging environments,
and only becomes a problem once production data is sent to the database.

**Recommended Action:**

Change the `character varying` or `character` column to be a `text` column type instead.

Sometimes `text` is not used initially since it is assumed the length limitation
improves performance based on experience with other databases. That is not correct for
PostgreSQL, using something like `character varying (255)` actually has a slight CPU cost,
since the length needs to be validated at runtime.

You can use the following to change the data type for a column to `text`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE my_table ALTER COLUMN small_column TYPE text;
```

Since [Postgres 9.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/release-9-2.html#AEN114949)
increasing the character limit, including going from `varchar` to `text`
can be done without a full table rewrite, so this is usually safe to run on
production systems.

**Example Log Output:**

```
ERROR:  value too long for type character varying(3)
STATEMENT:  INSERT INTO my_table(small_column) VALUES ('zzzzz')
```
