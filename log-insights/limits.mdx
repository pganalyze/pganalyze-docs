Log Insights has a rate limit of 1 GB of log data per day for each server. Limits for
each server in your organization are tracked separately. Additional log quota can be added
to your plan by contacting [pganalyze Support](mailto:support@pganalyze.com).

Log Insights limits are not present in the [Enterprise version](/enterprise-postgres-monitoring).

In addition, certain values of some Postgres log settings are not supported for
Log Insights ([see below](#unsupported-log-settings)).


## How Log Insights rate limiting works

As the collector sends Log Insights data to pganalyze for processing, the service tracks
the total number of bytes received for each server. Each server starts with a 1 GB quota
that is continuously refilled at the rate of 1 GB per day.

Effectively, each server has a 1 GB allotment of log data over a rolling 1 day period. This
allows for sending bursts of log data as long as the average rate is under 1 GB per day.

When incoming log data exceeds the limit for a particular server, the affected log lines
are not recorded by pganalyze and will not show up in Log Insights. EXPLAIN plans and query
samples present in affected lines are still recorded. The amount of log lines dropped, in
bytes, is recorded whenever the rate limit is exceeded. This is visible as a warning when
you visit the Log Insights page for an affected server.


All logs processed by the collector count toward this limit.

## Settings to adjust to stay under the rate limit

There are a number of [Postgres log settings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html)
that can be adjusted to help you stay under this threshold:

 - Disable `log_duration` if set
 - Set `log_statement` to 'none' or 'ddl'
 - Ensure `log_min_messages` is not set below the default level of 'warning'
 - Raise `auto_explain.log_min_duration` (if using `auto_explain`) or `log_min_duration_statement`
 - Use `auto_explain.sample_rate` (if using `auto_explain`)
 - Use `log_min_duration_sample` and `log_statement_sample_rate` instead of `log_min_duration_statement`
 - Disable `log_disconnections` and `log_connections` if you do not need these for auditing
 - Increase `deadlock_timeout` or disable `log_lock_waits`


## Unsupported log settings

Certain Postgres log settings tend to cause excessive log volume and are not supported for
Log Insights. Depending on the setting, the collector will either discard log lines related
to that setting, or the collector will not process logs at all, and Log Insights will not be
available for that server. A warning will be logged in these situations. Other pganalyze
features will continue to work normally.

The following settings are not supported:

    <tr>
      <th>Setting</th>
      <th>Unsupported value</th>
      <th>Effect</th>
