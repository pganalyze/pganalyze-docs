Log Insights has a rate limit of 1 GB of log data per day for each server. Limits for
each server in your organization are tracked separately.

Log Insights limits are not present in the [Enterprise version](/enterprise-postgres-monitoring).


## How Log Insights rate limiting works

As the collector sends Log Insights data to pganalyze for processing, the service tracks
the total number of bytes received for each server. Each server starts with a 1 GB quota
that is continuously refilled at the rate of 1 GB per day.

Effectively, each server has a 1 GB allotment of log data over a rolling 1 day period. This
allows for sending bursts of log data as long as the average rate is under 1 GB per day.

When incoming log data exceeds the limit for a particular server, the affected log lines
are not recorded by pganalyze and will not show up in Log Insights. Query samples present
in affected lines are still recorded. The amount of log lines dropped, in bytes, is
recorded whenever the rate limit is exceeded. This is visible as a warning when you visit
the Log Insights page for an affected server.

All Postgres logs processed by the collector count toward this limit.

## Settings to adjust to stay under the rate limit

There are a number of [Postgres log settings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html)
that can be adjusted to help you stay under this threshold:

 - Disable `log_duration` if set
 - Set `log_statement` to 'none' or 'ddl'
 - Ensure `log_min_messages` is not set below the default level of 'warning'
 - Raise `auto_explain.log_min_duration` (if using `auto_explain`) or `log_min_duration_statement`
 - Use `auto_explain.sample_rate` (if using `auto_explain`)
 - Use `log_min_duration_sample` and `log_statement_sample_rate` instead of `log_min_duration_statement`
 - Disable `log_disconnections` and `log_connections` if you do not need these for auditing
 - Increase `deadlock_timeout` or disable `log_lock_waits`
