**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: redo starts at 4E8/AF9458E8
...
LOG: redo done at 4E8/BDA7A9A8
LOG: last completed transaction was at log time 2018-03-12 02:09:12.585354+00
```

```
LOG: redo is not required
```

**Explanation:**

These log events describe the recovery process in more detail, which occurs either
after crash recovery, or when bringing up a follower server.

They most useful for context on what happened, in particular which WAL location we
were at when the last checkpoint occurred (`redo starts at`), and which WAL location
we reached once all WAL files have been applied, and e.g. `recovery_target` has been
reached.

**Recommended Action:**

No action needed.
