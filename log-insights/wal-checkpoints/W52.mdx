**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: archive command failed with exit code 1
DETAIL: The failed archive command was: /etc/rds/dbbin/pgscripts/rds_wal_archive pg_xlog/0000000100025DFA00000023
```

```
FATAL: archive command was terminated by signal 6: Abort trap
DETAIL: The failed archive command was: /usr/local/bin/envdir /usr/local/etc/wal-e.d/env /usr/local/bin/wal-e wal-push pg_xlog/000000040000023B000000CC
LOG:  archiver process (PID 5886) exited with exit code 1
```

**Explanation:**

PostgreSQL failed to archive a WAL file, as the configured `archive_command` exited
with a non-zero exit code, or the program got terminated.

This typically occurs because of a problem with the program you are using for
archiving / backups, and you will need to check its log files to determine what
exactly happened.

Note that this can be a problematic situation, as Postgres has to retain all WAL
files it could not archive, regardless of any `max_wal_size` you might have
configured.

That means if you do not resolve this failure (and make `archive_command` complete
successfully for the failed segments), you will eventually run out of disk on your
WAL partition.

**Recommended Action:**

Investigate the underlying failure in the log files of your backup program.

If you are okay with not having reliable backups and potentially missing a file,
in order to avoid running out of disk space you can also temporarily change
your configuration to `archive_command = /bin/true` which will make Postgres
succeed at archiving all WAL files.

Note in the case of the WAL file not being copied correctly, you are highly
advised to make a new base backup after the situation has been resolved.
