**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: started streaming WAL from primary at 4E8/9E000000 on timeline 6
```

```
LOG: restarted WAL streaming at 3E/62000000 on timeline 3
```

**Explanation:**

This log event indicates that the standby server has switched from
archive recovery (or a base backup download) to streaming replication.

You would typically see this once the follower has caught up enough that the
primary still has all WAL segments available for the follower.

**Recommended Action:**

No action needed, this event indicates that streaming replication is working.
