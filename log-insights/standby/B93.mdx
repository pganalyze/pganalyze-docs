**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
FATAL: terminating walreceiver process due to administrator command
```

**Explanation:**

This log message indicates that streaming replication has been stopped.

You may see this when an operator / DBA calls `pg_terminate_backend` on the
walreceiver process responsible for streaming replication, or Postgres decides
that streaming replication should be stopped, e.g. during server shutdown.

Note that streaming replication will attempt to restart after the walreceiver was
stopped, so this is commonly only useful to force a reconnect of the secondary
to the primary.

**Recommended Action:**

No action needed, although if unexpected during regular operations it makes
sense to verify that streaming was started up again by checking for
[B91 - Started streaming WAL from primary](/docs/log-insights/standby/B91).
