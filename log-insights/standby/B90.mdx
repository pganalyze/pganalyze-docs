**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: restored log file "00000006000004E80000009C" from archive
```

**Explanation:**

This log line indicates that Postgres has successfully restored a log file (= WAL segment)
from the WAL archive using `restore_command`.

You will see this message during normal standby operations, if streaming replication
is not active.

**Recommended Action:**

Typically no action needed, this log message only indicates the progress that is being
made for replaying the primary's WAL on the standby server.

Note that this does indicate that your standby is currently not using streaming replication,
which may be a problem in terms of potential replication lag.
