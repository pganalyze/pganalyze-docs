**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
FATAL: could not receive data from WAL stream: SSL error: sslv3 alert unexpected message
```

**Explanation:**

This indicates that the receiving process for streaming replication on the standby
server was terminated since it couldn't stream any more changes from the
connection to the primary.

Typically you would see this when there is a network interruption between the
primary and the secondary.

After this event the primary will retry connecting, and if that fails consecutively
it will switch back to archive recovery.

**Recommended Action:**

Investigate the underlying network connection between primary and secondary. If
the connection works as expected, this may also be due to high load on the primary.
