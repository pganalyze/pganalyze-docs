**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
LOG: consistent recovery state reached at 4E8/9E0979A8
```

**Explanation:**

When a standby server first starts up it needs to read the WAL stream until the
first checkpoint it can use, which contains the necessary consistency data
to allow Hot Standby connections and query execution.

Note that this may be delayed more than the first checkpoint if you have
very long-lived transactions on the primary.

Before this point is reached, any client trying to connect will receive an error
message indicating that the server is not ready yet.

**Recommended Action:**

No action needed, this merely serves as information for when connections can
be accepted on a hot standby / follower server.
