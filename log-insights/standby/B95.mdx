**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: canceling statement due to conflict with recovery
DETAIL: User query might have needed to see row versions that must be removed.
STATEMENT: SELECT 1
```

**Explanation:**

This error will occur when the standby server gets updates/deletes in the WAL
stream that will invalidate data currently being accessed by a running query.

You will primary see this with long-running queries accessing tables with
significant activity on the primary.

**Recommended Action:**

There are two approaches to avoid this kind of query cancellation:

**1)** Set `hot_standby_feedback = on` on the standby, which passed back information
to the primary that certain rows are still needed in a table. This will cause
bloat on the primary, but allows queries on the secondary to finish reliably.

**2)** Increase `max_standby_archive_delay` / `max_standby_streaming_delay`,
which allows the standby server to intentionally increase replication lag to
allow queries to finish.

Depending on your use case, either 1) or 2) makes sense - you may also be okay
with queries occasionally being canceled, since you can simply try to resubmit
the query and it may succeed then.
