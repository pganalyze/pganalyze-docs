[Log Insights](https://pganalyze.com/log-insights) automatically extracts your Postgres
logs into structured data, and filters any sensitive information.

Note that you must be on the pganalyze **Scale** plan, or in your initial
14-day trial period, to integrate Log Insights. You must also have completed
the basic [query performance setup](/docs/install). Log Insights is subject
to [rate limits](/docs/log-insights/limits) for incoming log data.
