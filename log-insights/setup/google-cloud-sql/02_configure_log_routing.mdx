import imgCreateLogSink from './create-log-sink.png'

export const ImgCreateLogSink = () => <img src={imgCreateLogSink} alt="Screenshot of creating a log sink in Google Cloud Console" />

Navigate to your Cloud SQL database instance, click on "View PostgreSQL error logs", and then click on "Logs Router".

Click "Create Sink", and select your Pub/Sub topic. Make sure that the left side is actually
showing PostgreSQL logs (as it does in this screenshot), and that you don't have a different
type of resource selected:

<ImgCreateLogSink />

Now we need to create a service account that can access the logs sent to the Pub/Sub topic.
