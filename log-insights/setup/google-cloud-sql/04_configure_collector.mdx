Sign in to your virtual machine, and add the following configuration setting:
import CollectorLogTest from '../../../components/CollectorLogTest'

```
gcp_pubsub_subscription: projects/PROJECT_ID/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

This is the value of "Subscription name" you can see when clicking on the details for the Pub/Sub subscriber we created earlier.

Now test the collector configuration:

<CollectorLogTest provider="Google Cloud SQL" configFromEnv={props.configFromEnv} />
