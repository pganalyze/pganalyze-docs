Sign in to your virtual machine, and add the following configuration setting:

```
gcp_pubsub_subscription: projects/PROJECT_ID/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

This is the value of "Subscription name" you can see when clicking on the details for the Pub/Sub subscriber we created earlier.

Now test the collector configuration:

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --test --reload
```

This should return something like the following:

```
I [server1] Testing statistics collection...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (29.3 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing activity snapshots...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (2.44 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing log collection (Google Cloud SQL)...
I [server1]   Log test successful
I Successfully reloaded pganalyze collector (PID 123)
```
