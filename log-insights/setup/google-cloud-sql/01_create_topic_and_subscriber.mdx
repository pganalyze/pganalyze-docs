Log output on Google Cloud SQL is available through Cloud Pub/Sub.

In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "Pub/Sub" and create a new Topic, e.g. calling it "postgres-logs".

Next, create a Pub/Sub subscriber, with the following settings:

* **Subscription ID:** Name of your choice (e.g. "pganalyze-collector")
* **Cloud Pub/Sub topic:** Select the topic you just created
* **Delivery type:** Pull
* **Subscription expiration:** Leave at default (expire after 31 days)
* **Message retention duration:** 1 day
* **Retry policy:** Retry immediately

You now have the Pub/Sub topic and subscriber that can receive the Postgres log messages.
