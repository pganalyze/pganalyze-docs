### Error: "Could not get logs through Google Cloud Pub/Sub: Timeout"

This error occurs when we could not send a message end-to-end through the
database log and Pub/Sub pipeline in 10 seconds.

A common error cause is that the Project ID and/or CloudSQL instance ID do not
match the names that show in the log stream. Double check your pganalyze
collector configuration settings.
