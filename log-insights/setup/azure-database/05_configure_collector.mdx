To complete the setup, we can now go to your virtual machine that is running the collector, and enable access to the Azure Event Hub.

We go into the `pganalyze-collector.conf` configuration file, and add these two settings.
Note the values need to match what you created in Step 2:

```
azure_eventhub_namespace: pganalyze-test
azure_eventhub_name: postgres
```

When running the collector in a container, you will need to use these environment variables instead of the configuration file:

* `AZURE_EVENTHUB_NAMESPACE` (same as `azure_eventhub_namespace`)
* `AZURE_EVENTHUB_NAME` (same as `azure_eventhub_name`)

Thanks to the Managed Identity that's assigned to the VM, we don't need to specify any credentials here.

Run the collector test to verify the setup works:

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --test --reload
```

And you will see this output when its successful:

```
I [server1] Testing statistics collection...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (29.3 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing activity snapshots...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (2.44 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing log collection (Azure Database)...
I [server1]   Log test successful
I Successfully reloaded pganalyze collector (PID 123)
```

You will start seeing log data in pganalyze Log Insights within a few minutes.

We recommend setting up [Log-based EXPLAIN](https://pganalyze.com/docs/explain/setup/log_explain) as follow-up step, to automatically EXPLAIN slow queries in Postgres.
