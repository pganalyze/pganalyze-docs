import CollectorSettings from '../../../components/CollectorSettings'

To complete the setup, we can now go to your virtual machine that is running the collector, and enable access to the Azure Event Hub.

Next, update the collector configuration for this server. Note the **values need to match** what you created in Step 2.

<CollectorSettings settings={[
  ['azure_eventhub_namespace', '[namespace from step 2]'],
  ['azure_eventhub_name', '[name from step 2]'],
]} configFromEnv={props.configFromEnv} />

Thanks to the Managed Identity that's assigned to the VM, we don't need to specify any credentials here.

Run the collector test to verify the setup works:

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --test --reload
```

And you will see this output when its successful:

```
I [server1] Testing statistics collection...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (29.3 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing activity snapshots...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (2.44 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing log collection (Azure Database)...
I [server1]   Log test successful
I Successfully reloaded pganalyze collector (PID 123)
```
