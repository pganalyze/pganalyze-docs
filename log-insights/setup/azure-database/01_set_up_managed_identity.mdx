Log output on Azure Database for PostgreSQL is available through Azure Event Hub.

To start, we need to [create a new user-assigned Managed Identity](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity) through the Azure Portal.

After the Managed Identity is created, assign it to your virtual machine:

Now the pganalyze collector running inside the virtual machine will be able to call Azure REST APIs using the Managed Identity.
