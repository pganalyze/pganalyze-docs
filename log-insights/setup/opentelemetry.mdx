If you are running the database in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the
[`db_log_otel_server`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers) setting to
have the collector listen for OpenTelemetry log data model messages.
When this is specified, the collector will run an HTTP server behind the scenes
on the specified port to receive logs at the `/v1/logs` endpoint.
This should be a local address like `0.0.0.0:4318` and it's recommended to use
an unprivileged port number (1024 and up) to avoid running the HTTP server as
root.

**Note:** This currently only supports [CloudNativePG PostgreSQL logs](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/logging/#postgresql-log).

### Using with a pganalyze collector Helm chart

If you are deploying the pganalyze collector using a Helm chart, you can update
the values.yaml file to create a service for this HTTP server.
In values.yaml file, update the section of `service`:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`service:
  create: true
  name: pganalyze-collector-otel-service
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 4318
  targetPort: 4318
`}
</CodeBlock>

This will create a service with the name `pganalyze-collector-otel-service`.
Assuming you use [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) as a telemetry agent,
you can specify the created service as an OpenTelemetry HTTP endpoint, using the
[OpenTelemetry output plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/opentelemetry):

<CodeBlock language="text">
{`  [OUTPUT]
    name  opentelemetry
    match kube.*postgres*
    host  pganalyze-collector-otel-service
    port  4318
`}
</CodeBlock>

With this flow, Fluent Bit tails the logs of Postgres pods, sends the logs to the
pganalyze collector's OpenTelemetry HTTP endpoint (via `pganalyze-collector-otel-service`),
and the collector processes the logs.
