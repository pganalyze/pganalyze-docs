We can now configure the syslog receiver in the collector. Edit the collector
config and add the
[`db_log_syslog_server`](https://pganalyze.com/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers)
setting. This should be set to a local address on any free port:

```
db_log_syslog_server: 0.0.0.0:32514
```

(If using Docker, use the `LOG_SYSLOG_SERVER` environment variable instead.)

It's recommended to use an unprivileged port number (1024 and up) to avoid
running the collector as root.

Restart the collector.

Make sure that the port you've selected is not blocked by a firewall or security group rules.
E.g., in GCP, you'll need to add a firewall rule:

<img alt="GCP firewall rules allowing access on syslog port" src={imgGcpFirewallRules} />

In AWS, you'll need to add a security group rule:

<img alt="AWS Security Group allowing access on syslog port" src={imgAwsSecurityGroup} />

You can verify that the port is accessible with telnet:

```
$ telnet 203.0.113.2 50014
Trying 203.0.113.2...
Connected to 203.0.113.2.
Escape character is '^]'.
^]
telnet> quit
Connection closed.
```
