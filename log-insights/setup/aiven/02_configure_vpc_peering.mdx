Once you have moved your database into a VPC, follow the [Aiven instructions to
set up VPC
peering](https://help.aiven.io/en/articles/778836-using-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-peering)
between your Aiven database VPC and your collector VPC. The details will vary depending
on the Service Cloud Provider you are using with Aiven.

If running on AWS, be sure to also edit the route table for your collector VPC
to add the destination IP range for your VPC and your Peering connection target:
