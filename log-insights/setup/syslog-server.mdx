If your database logs are available via syslog, you can use the [`db_log_syslog_server`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers)
setting to have the collector listen for syslog messages from a remote server.
When this is specified, the collector will run the syslog server behind the
scenes on the specified port to receive syslog messages.
This should be a local address like "0.0.0.0:32514" and it's recommended to use
an unprivileged port number (1024 and up) to avoid running the syslog server as
root.

Note that you need to use protocol RFC5424, with a TCP connection. To secure the
connection between the client (i.e., the server that sends logs) and the
collector syslog server, it is recommended to either use this integration over
private networks, or send logs over TLS.
While using TLS, if there is a need to ensure that logs are sent exclusively by
a trusted client, you might want to consider enabling mutual TLS, as described
in the following section.

### Receiving syslog over TLS

You can also receive logs over TLS by specifying the path of a certificate [`db_log_syslog_server_cert_file`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers)
and a secret key [`db_log_syslog_server_key_file`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers).
Alternatively, you can also set the actual contents of a certificate with [`db_log_syslog_server_cert_contents`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers),
or a secret key with [`db_log_syslog_server_key_contents`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers).
Please note that if the `db_log_syslog_server_cert_file` setting is provided,
the connection needs to be made as TLS and connection attempts without TLS will
be rejected.

This certificate is for the syslog server running as part of the collector. You
have the option to use an existing certificate or generate a new self-signed
certificate specifically for this purpose. In cases where a self-signed
certificate or a certificate from an untrusted authority is used, it is also
essential to specify the path to the TLS Certificate Authority (CA) certificate(s)
with the [`db_log_syslog_server_ca_file`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers)
setting. This CA certificate must also be provided to the client that is sending
out logs to the syslog server, such as rsyslog.

With these settings, logs from the client (like rsyslog) to the collector syslog
server will be sent over TLS.

You can also enable mutual TLS to ensure that the client side is also verified.
The client side can provide a certificate for this, and if this certificate is
a self-signed certificate or a certificate from an untrusted authority, the
collector syslog server needs to know about the CA certificate for it. You can
specify the CA certificate of the client side using the [`db_log_syslog_server_client_ca_file`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers)
or [`db_log_syslog_server_client_ca_contents`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers)
setting.
