If your database logs are available via syslog, you can use the [`db_log_syslog_server`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers)
setting to have the collector listen for syslog messages from a remote server. This should be a local address like
"0.0.0.0:32514" and it's recommended to use an unprivileged port number (1024 and up) to avoid running
the collector as root.

Note that you need to use protocol RFC5424, with an unencrypted TCP connection. Due to syslog not being
an authenticated protocol it is recommended to only use this integration over private networks.
