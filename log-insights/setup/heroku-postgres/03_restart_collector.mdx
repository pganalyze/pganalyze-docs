import imgLogInsights from './log_insights.png'

To finish, restart the collector app:

```bash
heroku restart -a testapp-pganalyze-collector
```

Afterwards, check the app logs again.

```bash
heroku logs -a testapp-pganalyze-collector -t
```

If the collector was able to match the log data to the correct database, you will see a log line like this after about a minute:

```
2018-05-20T21:22:19.854980+00:00 app[web.1]: I [TESTAPP_URL] Submitted compact logs snapshot successfully
```

<PublicOnly>
  <p>And then when you check the pganalyze interface, you will see Log Insights data:</p>
  <p>
    <img src={imgLogInsights} alt='Screenshot of pganalyze Log Insights feature' />
  </p>
</PublicOnly>

Note that on Heroku Postgres you have [limited configuration options](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-settings),
but you may want to review the defaults of:

```
log_min_duration_statement = 2000
log_lock_waits = on
log_statement = ddl
```

You can see details on what these settings do in our [tuning guide](https://pganalyze.com/docs/log-insights/setup/tuning-log-config-settings).
