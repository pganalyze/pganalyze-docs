Log output support is only available on Heroku Postgres Standard, Premium and higher plans.

Log output for Heroku Postgres databases is sent to the application that the
database is attached to, so we need to add a log drain to that application that
forwards log lines to the pganalyze collector app running in your account.

The collector receives log drains at the following URL:

```
https://testapp-pganalyze-collector.herokuapp.com/logs/[ALIAS]
```

For the `[ALIAS]` value we recommend you use the add-on attachment name you've chosen
in the initial setup, which you can determine by viewing the current Heroku
configuration of your collector app:

```bash
heroku config -a [your-collector-app-name]
```
<TestAppConfigVars apiKey={props.apiKey} />

So in this case we would use `TESTAPP_URL` as our alias, and then we would add the log drain
like this:

```bash
heroku drains:add https://[your-collector-app-name].herokuapp.com/logs/TESTAPP_URL -a testapp
```

Make sure to replace `[your-collector-app-name]` with the name of your own collector application
that you've deployed in your Heroku account.
