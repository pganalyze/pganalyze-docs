Note that both individual files and directories are supported for `db_log_location`.

In the case of built-in Postgres logging you may run into the issue that
log files are by default written in a way that prevents users other than the
postgres user from accessing them. This is typically the case if the Postgres
`log_directory` is configured to be inside the `data_directory`.

We can check whether this is the case. Run the following command:

```
SHOW data_directory;
```

If the output is **not** a prefix of the `db_log_location` discovered above, you can
**skip the rest of this section** and proceed to the next step below.

Otherwise, if the `db_log_location` **is** inside the data directory, we need to make
some adjustments to grant the pganalyze user access to the logs.

First, choose a location for log files that is outside of the Postgres data directory,
and then set it up like this:

```
mkdir /my/log/directory
chown postgres:postgres /my/log/directory
```

Also make sure that the pganalyze user can access this directory, by making it a member
of the postgres group:

```
usermod -a -G postgres pganalyze
```

Then, adjust the Postgres configuration to log everything to this new directory by running
the following commands as a Postgres superuser:

```
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_directory = '/my/log/directory';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_file_mode = '0640';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```
