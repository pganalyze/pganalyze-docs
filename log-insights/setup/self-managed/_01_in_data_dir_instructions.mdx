If the Postgres `log_directory` is configured to be inside the `data_directory`,
log files are written out in a way that prevents users other than the postgres
user from accessing them by default. It's difficult to set up permissions that
both conform to security best practices and allow the pganalyze user access to
the logs in this configuration, so we recommend moving the `log_directory` out
of the data directory.

First, choose a location for log files that is outside of the Postgres data directory,
and then set it up like this:

```
sudo mkdir /my/log/directory
sudo chown postgres:postgres /my/log/directory
```

Also make sure that the pganalyze user can access this directory, by making it a member
of the postgres group:

```
sudo usermod -a -G postgres pganalyze
```

Then, adjust the Postgres configuration to log everything to this new directory by running
the following commands as a Postgres superuser:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_directory = '/my/log/directory';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_file_mode = '0640';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

Now, re-run

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --discover-log-location
```

and you should get the expected output from above with the `log_directory` you just configured.
