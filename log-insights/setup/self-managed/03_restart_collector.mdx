Once the log test is successful you need to restart the collector for the new configuration to take effect.
The command to restart the collector will depend on the platform you're running on (and you may need to
run as root or use sudo if available):

 * on systemd-based systems: systemctl restart pganalyze-collector
 * on upstart-based systems: restart pganalyze-collector
 * on sysvinit-based systems: service pganalyze-collector restart

(If you're not sure what type of system you're running on, you are most likely using systemd.)

After this you should see data showing up in the "Log Insights" tab in pganalyze in less than a minute:
