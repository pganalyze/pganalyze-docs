Log Insights works by continuously tailing your local Postgres log files, classifying log lines,
and submitting log data and statistics to pganalyze. The self-managed configuration requires
your collector to run on the same instance as your Postgres server.

In order to do set this up, you need to configure the `db_log_location` in the `pganalyze-collector.conf`
file, which should be either the Postgres log file, or the directory in which log files are located.

We provide a helper for discovering the log directory, which you must run as root or using sudo. Run the
command like this:

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --discover-log-location
```

This will then produce output like this:

```
2018/05/20 19:51:30 I [server1] Found log location, add this to your pganalyze-collector.conf in the [server1] section:
db_log_location = /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.3-main.log
```

Or alternately, like this:

```
2018/05/20 19:51:30 I [server1] Log location detected as syslog - please check our setup guide for rsyslogd or syslog-ng instructions
```

In some cases where discovery doesn't work you might have to review in more detail how your system is set up. Please
reach out to pganalyze support for help if needed.

Otherwise, continue below according to the discovered log location:
