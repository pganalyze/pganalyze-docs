Log Insights works by continuously tailing your local Postgres log files, classifying log lines,
and submitting log data and statistics to pganalyze. This requires your collector to run on the same
instance as your Postgres server.

In order to do set this up, you need to configure the `db_log_location` in the `pganalyze-collector.conf`
file, which should be either the Postgres log file, or the directory in which log files are located.

We provide a helper for discovering the log directory, which you can run like this as root:

```
pganalyze-collector --discover-log-location
```

This will then produce output like this:

```
2018/05/20 19:51:30 I [server1] Found log location, add this to your pganalyze-collector.conf in the [server1] section:
db_log_location = /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.3-main.log
```

In some cases where discovery doesn't work you might have to review in more detail how your system is set up. Please
reach out to pganalyze support for help if needed.

Note that both individual files and directories are supported for `db_log_location`.

## Allowing access when using Postgres built-in logging

In the case of built-in Postgres logging you may run into the issue that
log files are by default written in a way that prevents users other than the
postgres user from accessing them. This is typically the case if the Postgres
`log_directory` is configured to be inside the `data_directory`.

We need to grant the pganalyze user access to them, by doing the following:

First choose a location for log files thats outside of the Postgres data directory,
and then set it up like this:

```
mkdir /my/log/directory
chown postgres:postgres /my/log/directory
```

Also make sure that the pganalyze user can access this directory, by making it a member of the postgres group:

```
usermod -a -G postgres pganalyze
```

Adjust the Postgres configuration to log everything to this new directory by doing the following:

```
log_directory = '/my/log/directory'
log_file_mode = 0640
```

Reload Postgres afterwards, as well as **restart** the collector background process, and then re-run the permission
test as described in Step 2.

## Allowing access when using rsyslogd built-in logging

For rsyslogd and other syslog daemons, the issue can often be that new log files
are created with permissions that don't allow the pganalyze user access.

Assuming that the log files are owned by the Postgres user, you first
need to add the pganalyze user to the postgres group:

```
usermod -a -G postgres pganalyze
```

And then make sure that new files are written with chmod 640, in your `/etc/rsyslog.conf`:

```
# Place this at the beginning of the rsyslog.conf file:
$umask 0000
$FileCreateMode 0600

# Place this where the postgres log is being output
$FileCreateMode 0640
local0.* /var/log/postgres/postgres.log
$FileCreateMode 0600
```

As well as making sure the current log file has the correct permissions:

```
chmod 640 /var/log/postgres/postgres.log
```
