one that is managed and configured by yourself, instead of one that is provided as a service by
a cloud provider.

## Prerequisites
 * the collector is running on your database server directly, and not on another system

## Installation steps
 * [Step 1: Locate your PostgreSQL log file / directory](/docs/log-insights/setup/self-managed/01_determine_log_location)
 * [Step 2: Configure collector](/docs/log-insights/setup/self-managed/02_configure_collector)
 * [Step 3: Restart your collector](/docs/log-insights/setup/self-managed/03_restart_collector)
 * [Troubleshooting](/docs/log-insights/setup/self-managed/troubleshooting)
