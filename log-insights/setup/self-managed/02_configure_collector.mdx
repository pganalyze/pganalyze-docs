We can now configure the log directory for the collector, by adding the `db_log_location` setting,
similar to this:

```
db_log_location: [log location discovered in Step 1]
```

Then, use the `--test` option of the collector to verify that log collection and parsing works:

```
pganalyze-collector --test
```

In the successful case, the log output will look like this:

```
