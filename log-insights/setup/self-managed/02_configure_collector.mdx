We can now configure the log directory for the collector, by adding the `db_log_location` setting, so the configuration file looks similar to this:

```
[pganalyze]
api_key: XXX

[server1]
db_name: postgres, *
db_username: pganalyze
db_password: mypassword
db_host: 127.0.0.1
db_port: 5432
db_log_location: /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.3-main.log
```

Now we can use the `--test` option of the collector to verify that log collection and parsing works:

```
pganalyze-collector --test
```

In the successful case, the log output will look like this:

```
2018/05/08 08:40:06 I [server1] Testing statistics collection...
2018/05/08 08:40:07 I [server1] Test submission successful (15.8 KB received)
2018/05/08 08:40:07 I [server1] Testing local log tailing...
2018/05/08 08:40:13 I [server1] Log test successful
2018/05/08 08:40:13 I Re-running log test with reduced privileges of "pganalyze" user (uid = 107, gid = 113)
2018/05/08 08:40:13 I [server1] Testing local log tailing...
2018/05/08 08:40:19 I [server1] Log test successful
```

There are a few error cases, in particular permission related ones for the "log test with reduced privileges", which you will likely encounter. They are documented at the end of this page.
