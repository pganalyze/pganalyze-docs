Note that both individual files and directories are supported for `db_log_location`.

If the `db_log_location` was discovered by the collector, you only need to confirm
that the pganalyze user has access to the log files. Check this with ls:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`ls -l [discovered_log_location]`}
</CodeBlock>

This will show output like

```
-rw-r----- 1 postgres adm 0 Feb 17 00:00 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log
```

The fourth field here (`adm` in this case) is the group that owns the log files. If
this is **not** `adm` on your system, you should add the pganalyze user to this group.
E.g., if the owning group is `postgres`, run the following:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`sudo usermod -a -G postgres pganalyze`}
</CodeBlock>

Then, update the file permissions of newly created log files to ensure group read
permissions:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`ALTER SYSTEM SET log_file_mode = '0640';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();`}
</CodeBlock>
