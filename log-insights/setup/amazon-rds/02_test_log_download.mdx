Now you can test whether the collector can actually access your RDS logs correctly,
by running the following:

```
pganalyze-collector --test
```

If this works correctly you will see output like this:

```
I [server1] Testing statistics collection...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (106 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing activity snapshots...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (2.12 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing log collection (Amazon RDS)...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (86 Bytes received, server abc123)
I [server1]   Log test successful
```

If you are getting an error, it sometimes helps to run the test with the `-v` flag to show all details:

```
pganalyze-collector --test -v
```

In case you get permission errors, make sure your IAM user has the [appropriate policy associated](https://pganalyze.com/docs/install/amazon_rds/03_setup_iam_policy).
