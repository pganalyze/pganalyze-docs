import imgLogInsightsScreenshot from '../log_insights_screenshot.png'

In order to make this change permanent, reload the collector:

```
pganalyze-collector --reload
```

You will then see Log Insights data on your database within a few minutes:

<img src={imgLogInsightsScreenshot} alt='Screenshot of pganalyze Log Insights feature' />

We recommend that you also
[tune a few configuration parameters](https://pganalyze.com/docs/log-insights/setup/tuning-log-config-settings)
to get useful log output from Postgres.
