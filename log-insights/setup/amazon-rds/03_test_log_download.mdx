Now you can test whether the collector can actually access your RDS logs correctly,
by running the following:

```
pganalyze-collector --test --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will automatically load the new configuration if the test succeeds.
If this works correctly you will see output like this:

```
I [server1] Testing statistics collection...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (106 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing activity snapshots...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (2.12 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing log collection (Amazon RDS)...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (86 Bytes received, server abc123)
I [server1]   Log test successful
```

If you are getting an error, it sometimes helps to run the test with the `--verbose` flag to show all details:

```
pganalyze-collector --test --reload --verbose
```

In case you get permission errors, review the policy we defined in [Step 1](01_set_up_iam_policy) and any
changes you may have made.

    We recommend that you also <a href="https://pganalyze.com/docs/log-insights/setup/tuning-log-config-settings">tune a few configuration parameters</a>
    to get useful log output from Postgres.
