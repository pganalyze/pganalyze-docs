Log Insights works by continuously fetching your Postgres log files from AWS, classifying log
lines, and submitting log data and statistics to pganalyze. The RDS configuration usually
does not require any additional configuration beyond the steps you performed as part of basic
setup, so we can proceed directly to testing the integration.

<CollectorLogTest provider="Amazon RDS" configFromEnv={props.configFromEnv} />

The collector will start sending logs shortly.

<PublicOnly>
  <p>
    The collector will only collect log data when you have an Amazon RDS host name specified (the
    instance/cluster name is auto-detected), or you manually specify the <code>aws_db_instance_id</code>/<code>aws_db_cluster_id</code> and{" "}
    <code>aws_region</code> settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, you need to ensure that AWS APIs can be accessed either by using the EC2 metadata
    service, or by manually specifying the <code>aws_access_key_id</code> and <code>aws_secret_access_key</code>
    settings.

In case you get permission errors, make sure your IAM user has the [appropriate policy associated](/docs/install/amazon_rds/03_install_collector_ec2#set-up-iam-policy).

  <p>You will then see Log Insights data on your database within a few minutes:</p>

    We recommend that you also <a href="https://pganalyze.com/docs/log-insights/setup/tuning-log-config-settings">tune a
    few configuration parameters</a> to get useful log output from Postgres.
