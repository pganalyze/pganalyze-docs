Log Insights works by continuously fetching your Postgres log files from AWS, classifying log
lines, and submitting log data and statistics to pganalyze. The RDS configuration usually
does not require any additional configuration beyond the steps you performed as part of basic
setup, so we can proceed directly to testing the integration.

You can test whether the collector can actually access your RDS logs correctly by running
the following:

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --test --reload
```

If this works, you will see output like this:

```
I [server1] Testing statistics collection...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (106 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing activity snapshots...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (2.12 KB received, server abc123)
I [server1] Testing log collection (Amazon RDS)...
I [server1]   Test submission successful (86 Bytes received, server abc123)
I [server1]   Log test successful
I Successfully reloaded pganalyze collector (PID 123)
```

The collector will start sending logs shortly.

If you are getting an error, it sometimes helps to run the test with the `-v` flag to show all
details:

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --test -v
```

    The collector will only collect log data when you have an Amazon RDS host name specified (the
    instance name is auto-detected), or you manually specify the <code>aws_db_instance_id</code> and
    <code>aws_region</code> settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, you need to ensure that AWS APIs can be accessed either by using the EC2 metadata
    service, or by manually specifying the <code>aws_access_key_id</code> and <code>aws_secret_access_key</code>
    settings.

In case you get permission errors, make sure your IAM user has the [appropriate policy associated](https://pganalyze.com/docs/install/amazon_rds/03_setup_iam_policy).

    We recommend that you also <a href="https://pganalyze.com/docs/log-insights/setup/tuning-log-config-settings">tune a
    few configuration parameters</a> to get useful log output from Postgres.
