If you are running the database in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the
[`db_log_otel_server`](/docs/collector/settings#self-managed-servers) setting to
have the collector listen for OpenTelemetry log data model messages.
When this is specified, the collector will run an HTTP server behind the scenes
on the specified port to receive logs at the `/v1/logs` endpoint. Currently, this endpoint
expects OpenTelemetry log messages sent as protobuf.

The configuration setting should be local address like `0.0.0.0:4318` and
it's recommended to use an unprivileged port number (1024 and up) to avoid
running the HTTP server as root.


<CodeBlock language="text">
{`[pganalyze]
api_key = your_pga_organization_api_key
 
[server1]
db_host = your_db_host
...
db_log_otel_server = 0.0.0.0:4318`}
</CodeBlock>

### Multiple OpenTelemetry endpoints
If you have multiple Postgres clusters that you want to monitor through OpenTelemetry, you can
configure one pganalyze collector to start multiple OpenTelemetry HTTP servers on different ports,
each for a specific monitored cluster.

For each monitored server in the `pganalyze-collector.conf` file, you can specify
the `db_log_otel_server` setting with a different port number, like this:

<CodeBlock language="text">
{`[pganalyze]
api_key = your_pga_organization_api_key
 
[server1]
db_host = your_db_host
...
db_log_otel_server = 0.0.0.0:4318
 
[server2]
db_host = your_db_host2
...
db_log_otel_server = 0.0.0.0:4319`}
</CodeBlock>

This would start two OpenTelemetry HTTP servers, one on port 4318 and another on port 4319 when 
the collector starts. To verify, you can start the collector with verbose logging to verify 
output similar to the example below.

```
$ sudo pganalyze-collector --verbose
...
...
2025/07/29 11:20:53 I Setting up OTLP HTTP server receiving logs with 0.0.0.0:4318
2025/07/29 11:20:53 I Setting up OTLP HTTP server receiving logs with 0.0.0.0:4319
...
```


## Using with a pganalyze collector Helm chart

If you are deploying the pganalyze collector using a Helm chart, you can update
the values.yaml file to create a service for this HTTP server.
In values.yaml file, update the section of `service`:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`service:
  create: true
  name: pganalyze-collector-otel-service
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 4318
  targetPort: 4318`}
</CodeBlock>

This will create a service with the name `pganalyze-collector-otel-service`.

To create multiple OpenTelemetry endpoints, you can add multiple port entries under the `ports` section:

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`service:
  create: true
  name: pganalyze-collector-otel-service
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: pganalyze-collector-otel1
      port: 4318
      targetPort: 4318
    - name: pganalyze-collector-otel2
      port: 4319
      targetPort: 4319`}
</CodeBlock>

When there is a `ports` section, the Helm chart will ignore the settings 
for any individual `port` and `targetPort` settings.

## Log forwarding with Fluent Bit or Vector

We recommend using either [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) or
[Vector](https://vector.dev/) for processing logs from your Kubernetes
cluster and forwarding them to the collector's OTLP logs endpoint:

* [Setup instructions for Fluent Bit](/docs/log-insights/setup/opentelemetry/fluentbit)
* [Setup instructions for Vector](/docs/log-insights/setup/opentelemetry/vector)

### Troubleshooting Fluent Bit, Vector and other OTLP payloads

One of the common issues when using Fluent Bit with OpenTelemetry is that
the payloads are sent in Protobuf format (either binary or JSON encoded) which
is a compact, efficient transport format, yet difficult to debug on the receiving
end when it doesn't match the expected OpenTelemetry log data model.

To assist with troubleshooting, you can set the `--very-verbose` runtime parameter
for the pganalyze collector. This will log the raw Protobuf payloads received
by the OpenTelemetry HTTP server and output them as JSON, which can help you 
identify if the payloads are correctly formatted and match the expected OpenTelemetry 
log data model.

**Note:** Before starting another collector to test for OpenTelemetry input, you will have to 
stop the collector background process to avoid port conflicts. For package based installs
you can do this through `systemctl stop pganalyze-collector`.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`$ sudo systemctl stop pganalyze-collector
 
$ sudo pganalyze-collector --very-verbose`}
</CodeBlock>

This will start the collector with very verbose logging enabled, and you should see
output like this when it receives a Protobuf payload. 

**Warning:** this output is very verbose and could quickly become overwhelming, 
so it's recommended to use it only for troubleshooting purposes for a short period of time.
