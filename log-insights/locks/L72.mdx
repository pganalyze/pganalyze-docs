**Example Postgres Log Output:**

```
ERROR: canceling statement due to lock timeout
CONTEXT: while updating tuple (24,41) in relation "mytable"
STATEMENT: UPDATE mytable SET y = 2 WHERE x = 1
```

**Explanation:**

This log event only occurs when `lock_timeout` was enabled for the connection,
and the statement had to wait longer than the specified time for a lock.

Note that you won't see this message if `statement_timeout` is smaller than
`lock_timeout`, as lock acquisition time is already included in the statement
timeout.

It is not recommended to set this timeout for everything, instead only setting
it for specific connections (e.g. by configuring it for a specific role that
is used by web servers). Most of the time you will find `statement_timeout`
more useful, unless you are exhibiting a lot of locking problems and have
experimented with this setting before.

**Recommended Action:**

This points to a lock contention issue on your database, or another unexpected
locking situation.

When `log_lock_waits` is enabled,
[L71 - Process still waiting for lock on tuple / relation / object](/docs/log-insights/locks/L71)
can give more details on which processes are holding the requested lock.
