Single Sign-On (or SSO) enables management of user access to your organization
through a third-party identity provider.

pganalyze integrates with providers such as Okta and Azure AD using [SAML
2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0). This feature is only available on
the [Scale Plan](/pricing) and higher. Note that the feature is not available
during a trial.

## Provider integration

If you integrate with Okta, you can follow the [Okta
integration](/docs/accounts/sso/okta) steps.

For all other providers, you can follow the [Custom SAML 2.0
integration](/docs/accounts/sso/saml2) steps.

## Default membership

New users that authenticate through SSO for the first time will receive the
standard "View & Modify (All Servers)" permission in your organization, unless
you specify the default role during the integration setup. You can change the
default role after completing the integration setup, but note that this will
_not_ change the role assigned to users who have already authenticated through SSO.

## Migrating to Single Sign-On

Once you have enabled Single Sign-On, in order to authenticate to pganalyze with
SSO, users must sign in through your SSO provider portal, not through pganalyze
itself. You currently cannot turn off username/password authentication for your
whole organization. Instead, you can remove all non-SSO users from the
organization. Members utilizing Single Sign-On can be identified on the
**Members** settings page by the `Single Sign-On Required?` column:

Any existing username/password users in your organization who subsequently
authenticate through SSO will be converted to SSO accounts tied to your
organization. They will no longer be able to log in with username/password
after their initial SSO login.

Note that this only applies to users who have accepted their invitation and who
do not belong to any other organizations. Users who have not accepted their
membership will be treated as new users (see [Default
Membership](#default-membership) above). Users who belong to other organizations
will receive a separate account for your organization, with the roles of their
original account (the original account will be removed from your organization).

If you run into any problems with converting users to Single Sign-on, please
[reach out to pganalyze Support](mailto:support@pganalyze.com).

## Removing user accounts

If a user has left your organization, and you have removed them from your
identity provider, they will continue to show as a member in pganalyze, even
though they can no longer sign in. You can remove the members in pganalyze by
going to the **Members** settings page.

We plan to support System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) in the
future to help with automated ahead of time provisioning and deprovisioning of
user accounts.

## Turning off Single Sign-On

If you'd like to register a different SAML Identity Provider (IdP), or turn off
SSO, you can reset the SSO integration. This requires being logged in as a
username/password based user with the [manage
permission](/docs/accounts/permissions). You can then click the "Reset
integration" button on the **Integrations** settings page:

Resetting the integration will remove all organization members that are linked
with the IdP.

**All linked permissions and other per-user customizations will be lost with the
reset.**
