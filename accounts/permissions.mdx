Permissions are set for roles, and roles are assigned to members of your organization.

Every member of your organization gets to see the list of all other members in the organization,
but can't access any database information without having the **View** permission on them.

Permissions are additive-only - that means if you grant a role that gives
unrestricted access to all databases and servers, another restrictive permission
that is also assigned will not restrict access for them.

## View

Allows the member to see statistics information for a database, including full
query details as well as complete log information when using Log Insights.

## Modify

Allows the member to acknowledge check-ups and change configuration settings in pganalyze
for the databases and servers they have the modify permission on.

## Billing

Allows the member to input billing details, change the subscription an organization
is on, as well as view invoices.

You cannot restrict the billing permission to a specific database or server.

## API

Allows the member to see API keys, typically required for integrating the pganalyze collector on a server.

You cannot restrict the API permission to a specific database or server.

## Manage

Allows the member to invite/add new members with any of the above permissions,
create new roles and change the permissions of existing roles, as well
as remove any other member from the organization.

This also grants the permission to create new servers in the organization, as well
as removing existing servers and their statistics.

You cannot restrict the manage permission to a specific database or server.

**Hint:** No roles grant access to your database server, as pganalyze operates in a push model - the open-source [pganalyze-collector](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector) is the only component able to access your database directly.
