<DocsBetaFeature feature="Query Tuning" />

Query optimization often involves recognizing and addressing common patterns that lead
to suboptimal performance. While seasoned database engineers may spot these patterns
through experience, Query Tuning helps identify and solve them systematically. Each
pattern has specific indicators that suggest its presence, methods to validate the
issue, and proven approaches to resolve it.

We'll explore three common patterns that often impact query performance.

## Inefficient Nested Loops Pattern

When the query planner chooses nested loops for joins where other strategies might be
more efficient, Query Tuning can help identify and resolve the issue.

### Detection

Query Tuning automatically flags cases where:

* Nested Loop joins show actual rows significantly higher than estimated
* Inner side operations consume substantial time

### Investigation

1. Create a new workbook and run EXPLAIN ANALYZE using the collector or upload your query's EXPLAIN ANALYZE plan manually
2. Review the automated analysis that highlights potential nested loop inefficiencies
3. Create variants to test alternative approaches:
   * Create a variant with enable_nestloop = off
   * If available, use pg_hint_plan to force Hash or Merge Join in another variant
4. Use Compare Plans to compare the execution plans side-by-side

### Benchmarking Solutions

1. Create a variant using MATERIALIZED to prevent parameterized scans
2. Compare the execution metrics between variants
3. Validate performance across different parameter sets

## GROUP BY Index Selection Pattern

This pattern occurs when GROUP BY operations lead to suboptimal index choices.

### Detection

Query Tuning flags:

* Index Scans lacking Index Conditions (using Filter only)
* Merge Joins where index sort order appears to take precedence over filtering
* Cases where parameterized index scans might be beneficial

### Investigation Process

1. Start with baseline plan analysis:
   * Upload your current EXPLAIN plan
   * Review highlighted index usage patterns
2. Check scan efficiency metrics
   * Create test variants:
   * Disable merge joins to test nested loop performance
3. Use pg_hint_plan if available to test specific join orders
   * Compare variant performance

### Benchmarking Solutions

1. Test MATERIALIZED query variants
2. Verify performance across different parameter sets
3. Use Compare Plans to understand execution strategy changes

## ORDER BY + LIMIT Pattern

This pattern involves cases where ORDER BY combined with LIMIT leads to suboptimal index usage.

### Detection

The workbook identifies:

* Index Scans with high filter removal rates
* Indexes being used primarily for sort ordering
* Potential quick sort scan inefficiencies

### Investigation Process

1. Initial Analysis:
   * Review highlighted metrics on filter removal rates
   * Check available indexes against WHERE conditions
2. Create variants to test:
   * Different index hints (using pg_hint_plan if available)
   * ORDER BY col+0 modification
   * enable_incremental_sort = off setting
3. Compare performance across variants

### Benchmarking Solutions

1. Test different statistics target values
2. Compare plans with and without incremental sort
3. Verify performance across different LIMIT values
4. Document the most effective approach
