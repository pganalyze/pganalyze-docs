![VACUUM Advisor Performance page](performance.png)

The Performance page in VACUUM Advisor gives you details about the efficiency of autovacuum operations, the utilization of autovacuum workers as well as issues where autovacuum couldn't run as planned.

## Metrics

For the key performance indicators (KPIs), you can see:

* **Avg. Autovacuum Workers**: The utilization of your autovacuum workers - if this is close to the maximum, an autovacuum backlog may occur, causing bloat and potential freezing issues.
* **Total Autovacuum Count**: The total number of autovacuums in the last 24 hours - use this to understand how busy a server is (compared to others) in terms of its autovacuum behavior.
* **Skipped Autovacuums**: How many regular autovacuums were skipped because another connection held a conflicting lock. This lock skipping does not apply to anti-wraparound vacuums, and can often times lead to a higher rate of anti-wraparound vacuums that have to do more work, causing higher I/O impact at one time.

Additionally, the Performance page shows:

* A per-table breakdown of how often a particular table was vacuumed in the last 24 hours, how long the vacuums took on average, and whether the vacuum had multiple index phases (an indication that `autovacuum_work_mem` is set too low, or too many dead rows were present at one time)
