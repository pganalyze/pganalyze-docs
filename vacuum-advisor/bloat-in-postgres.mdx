In Postgres, bloat refers to a situation when the physical size of a table on
disk is larger than its actual data size.

## Why does bloat happen?

In Postgres, any DELETEs or UPDATEs create dead rows in the tables they modify.
This is due to [the MVCC mechanism](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc-intro.html)
that Postgres uses to support concurrent transactions.
VACUUM allows Postgres to reclaim these dead rows and reuse that space for
future INSERTs or UPDATEs. Autovacuum is designed to perform VACUUM regularly in
order to efficiently reuse space. This helps prevent unnecessary table growth.

### Insufficient VACUUMs

If VACUUM is not performed with the appropriate frequency or at the right time,
dead rows may not be reclaimed, or may not be reclaimed quickly enough. This can
cause the table to grow, using new disk space even though there is available
unused space, since that unused space is still occupied by dead rows.

### Inefficient VACUUMs

Even when VACUUM is performed sufficiently, it's possible that dead rows still
cannot be reclaimed. This can happen when transactions are still accessing those
dead rows, and the xmin horizon — representing the point up to which VACUUM can
clean up dead rows — is held back.
As a result, VACUUM may not reclaim enough dead rows, leading to bloat.


## Why is bloat a problem?

Table bloat has several negative implications for the performance of your database.

### Slower queries

Since bloated tables take more physical space for the same amount of actual data,
they take longer to read from disk, and take up more room when cached in memory.
This makes queries on these tables less efficient, because they have to do more
work to scan the same amount of data.

### Increased disk space and I/O

Table bloat unnecessarily consumes additional disk space and requires more I/O
operations to read and write the same amount of actual data.


## How to avoid bloat

It is normal to have some bloat for tables with DELETEs or UPDATEs operations.
However, you want to pay attention when you see an increasing trend in bloat.
It is important to tune the VACUUM configuration to ensure VACUUMs are keeping
up with bloat.
It is also important to monitor your database and take action when the xmin
horizon is held back, to avoid inefficient VACUUMs.
pganalyze automatically performs checks to identify such cases, enabling you to
easily take appropriate actions.

## How to clean up existing bloat

Once bloat has accumulated, adjusting the frequency or efficiency of VACUUM
alone will not eliminate it. Bloat can only be eliminated when the space
occupied by dead rows becomes reusable through VACUUM, and there are more
INSERTs than DELETEs to utilize that space.

To clean up existing bloat, you have two options: `VACUUM FULL` or
[pg_repack](https://pganalyze.com/blog/5mins-postgres-pg-repack-VACUUM-FULL).
However, `VACUUM FULL` requires heavyweight locks and must rewrite the entire
table, which makes it impractical for most workloads. On the other hand,
pg_repack rewrites the table without taking long locks and it is recommended
approach over `VACUUM FULL`.
