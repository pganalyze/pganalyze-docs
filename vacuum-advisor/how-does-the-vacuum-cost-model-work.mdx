In Postgres, VACUUM can consume significant resources and, in the worst cases,
significantly impact database performance. To mitigate that, both manual VACUUM
commands and the autovacuum system are controlled by a simple cost model. The
cost model is designed to throttle the impact of running vacuum on an active
database.


## Cost model overview

The cost model is based around the idea that each VACUUM run has a certain
"budget" (`autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` or `vacuum_cost_limit`), and once that
budget is spent, the run is paused for a short while
(`autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` or `vacuum_cost_delay`). After this, the budget
is reset and the run can continue.

Certain operations that VACUUM performs in the course of a run are counted
against this budget:

 - a page that must be read from cache costs: `vacuum_cost_page_hit`
 - a page that must be read from "disk": `vacuum_cost_page_miss`
 - a page that must be written out after having been updated by vacuum: `vacuum_cost_page_dirty`

Note that "disk" is in quotes above, because that can include the operating
system page cache, or, in the case of systems like AWS Aurora, its network-based
storage system.

Note also that when multiple autovacuum workers are configured, the cost limit
is split equally among them, so adding more workers does not directly increase
the I/O impact.

Let's walk through an example. Say we have the following settings:
 - `vacuum_cost_page_hit`: 2 (to read a page from cache)
 - `vacuum_cost_page_miss`: 3 (to read a page from disk)
 - `vacuum_cost_page_dirty`: 20 (to write out a vacuumed page to disk)
 - `vacuum_cost_limit`: 25
 - `vacuum_cost_delay`: 20ms

If we vacuum a table consisting of three pages (only some needing cleanup),
vacuum will proceed as follows:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>action</th>
      <th style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>remaining budget</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>start vacuum</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>read page 1 (in cache)</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>skip page 1 (nothing to vacuum)</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>read page 2 (from disk)</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>write out page 2 after vacuum</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>sleep for 20ms due to cost limit (resets budget)</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>read page 3 (in cache)</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>write out page 3 after vacuum</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>done</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>-</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


## Modeling the worst-case impact of VACUUM

Given the cost model, we can calculate the theoretical maximum impact that
VACUUM can have on your system. If we assume that the actual VACUUM work takes
no time at all and that I/O is only limited by the cost model, we can determine
the impact by analyzing the various costs and the delay.

For read I/O, the formula considers the maximum number of pages that can be read
from disk before hitting the cost limit, and calculates that the max impact is
that many pages per cost delay interval. If the whole budget is used just reading
pages from disk, that would be as follows (configuration settings are in green
below; results of calculations in gray):

```
  max_page_misses = autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit / vacuum_cost_page_miss
```

To turn that into bytes, we multiply by block size (almost always 8kB):

```
  max_bytes_read = max_page_misses * block_size
```

And to turn that into a rate, we divide by the cost delay:

```
  max_vacuum_read_rate = max_bytes_read / autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay
```

For example, if `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` is 100, `vacuum_cost_page_miss` is 5,
`block_size` is the standard 8kB, and `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` is `10ms`, this
becomes

```
  max_page_misses = 100 / 5
  max_bytes_read = 20 * 8192 bytes
  max_vacuum_read_rate = 163840 bytes / 10ms = 16384000 bytes / sec ≈ 16 MB / sec
```


Similarly, for write I/O, the formula considers the maximum number of pages that
can be dirtied before hitting the cost limit, and calculates that the max impact
is that many pages per cost delay interval. If the whole budget is used just writing
pages to disk, that would be as follows:

```
  max_page_writes = autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit / vacuum_cost_page_dirty
```

Again, to turn that into bytes, we multiply by block size:

```
  max_bytes_written = max_page_writes * block_size
```

And as before, to turn that into a rate, we divide by the cost delay:

```
  max_vacuum_write_rate = max_bytes_written / autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay
```

So for example, if `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` is 100, `vacuum_cost_page_dirty` is 20,
`block_size` is the standard 8kB, and `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` is `10ms`, this
becomes

```
  max_page_writes = 100 / 20
  max_bytes_written = 5 * 8192 bytes
  max_vacuum_write_rate = 40960 bytes / 10ms = 4096000 bytes / sec ≈ 4 MB / sec
```

Note that this is a theoretical maximum. In reality, the impact will be lower
since the vacuuming itself will also take time. Furthermore, for writes, some of
the cost limit budget must be used to read pages before they can be written out.
Still, this gives a rough approximation of the upper bound of vacuum impact on
your system.
