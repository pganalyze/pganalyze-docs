## Use case

You can utilize this endpoint to export the currently active issues for a server
or database, as determined by the pganalyze Check-Up system, in order to export
them to a third-party system not directly supported by pganalyze's
[alerting integrations](/docs/checks/#alerting).

## API

Arguments for `getIssues`:

* **`serverId` (string)**<br/>Server ID for which to retrieve issues for
* **`databaseId` (string)**<br/>Database ID for which to retrieve issues for (either this or `serverId` needs to be specified)

Fields returned:

* **`issues` (Array of IssueType)**
  * **`id` (String)**<br/>Unique ID of this issue
  * **`databaseId` (Number)**<br/>Database ID this issue is related to
  * **`description` (String)**<br/>Issue description
  * **`severity` (String)**<br/>Issue severity (info, warning, critical)
  * **`references` (Array of IssueReferenceType)**
      * **`kind` (String)**<br/>Type of object this issue references
      * **`name` (String)**<br/>Name of the object this issue references
      * **`url` (String)**<br/>URL to the object this issue references
      * **`secondaryUrl` (String)** (optional)<br/>Secondary URL for an alternate object this issue references (e.g. active queries reference both the connection as well as the query object)
      * **`queryText` (String)** (optional)<br/>For query references, statement text of the query

## Example

GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  getIssues(serverId: 'bdp4m73ysjgefke7i2dgkenzi4') {
    id
    description
    severity
    references {
      name
      url
    }
  }
}
```

Using `curl`:

```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Token XXXXXXX' \
  -F 'query=query { getIssues(serverId: "bdp4m73ysjgefke7i2dgkenzi4") { id, description, severity, references { name, url } } }' \
  https://app.pganalyze.com/graphql
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getIssues": [
      {
        "id": "42",
        "description": "Setting shared_buffers is too small. For For MB RAM try using shared_buffers = 256 MB (current: 199 MB)",
