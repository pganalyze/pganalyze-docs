Welcome to the pganalyze API documentation!

We provide a GraphQL API that you can use to retrieve data that is available
in pganalyze. This is the same API that the pganalyze user interface uses to
retrieve data.

The documented endpoints represent what we officially support, whilst a lot of
other endpoints exist, these may change at any time and are considered private
APIs.

There are two classes of endpoints: 1) Query endpoints, which are used to retrieve
data. 2) Mutation endpoints, which are used to change (mutate) data.

## Overview

- [Creating an API key](/docs/api/create-api-key)
- [Queries](/docs/api/queries)
    * [getIssues - Get check-up issues and alerts](/docs/api/queries/getIssues)
    * [getQueryStats - Export query statistics](/docs/api/queries/getQueryStats)
- [Mutations](/docs/api/mutations)
    * [addServer - Add a server to pganalyze Enterprise Edition](/docs/api/mutations/addServer)

## Rate Limits

Note that this API is currently not rate limited, but we ask that you don't send
requests more than a few times per hour, to avoid unnecessary stress on our systems.

Based on usage patterns we may rate limit this API in the future.

## Other API requests

There are more GraphQL API endpoints available - please [contact us](mailto:team@pganalyze.com)
if you have a use case thats not fulfilled by the above.

We're happy to share details on private APIs that are only used by pganalyze itself,
with the disclaimer that they may change at any time.
