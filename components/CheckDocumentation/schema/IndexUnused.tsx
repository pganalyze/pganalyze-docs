        Detects indexes that are not in use by any queries within the last 14
        days and creates an issue with severity "info", one for each table (or
        table hierarchy in case of inheritance or partitioning). Resolves once all unused indexes on a table
        are dropped or start being used. Note that if you have gaps in your
        collector reporting, this check may miss usage during un-reported
        periods.

        Ignores small indexes (less than 32kB), as well as primary keys, unique
        indexes, and expression indexes since they are necessary to enforce
        constraints or useful as query planning hints.

      <h4>Impact</h4>
      <p>
        Postgres has to keep maintaining unused indexes for inserts, updates,
        and deletes to the table, slowing down writes. They also take up memory,
        competing with actively used indexes and table data. Larger unused
        indexes can also cause unnecessary disk space usage.
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>
        First, make sure these indexes are not in use in another database. You may
        need to check other environments that share the same schema, or verify that
        the index is not used on a read replica. If this server is a staging, QA or
        dev environment you may want to turn off the index unused check and only run
        it on production. You can also check usage of the associated table on the{" "}
        <Link to={databaseTableUrl}>Schema Statistics page for the table</Link>.{!indexes && (
          <>
            {" "}Once you've confirmed the indexes are safe to drop, you can clean them up by running{" "}
            <SQL inline sql={`DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY "<index_name>";`} />.

          <h4>Commands</h4>
          <p>
            Once you have confirmed the indexes are safe to drop, you can clean them up
            by running the following commands:
          </p>
          <CodeBlock>
            {indexes.map((qualifiedIdx) => (
              <React.Fragment key={qualifiedIdx} >
                <SQL inline sql={`DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY ${qualifiedIdx};`} />{"\n"}
              </React.Fragment>
            ))}
          </CodeBlock>
        </>
