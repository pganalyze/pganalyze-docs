import CollectorPkgInstallInstructions from '../../components/CollectorPkgInstallInstructions'

In this step we'll install the collector which sends statistics information to pganalyze.

First, you need to know which version of RHEL/CentOS/Fedora you are running. You can find out with this command:

```
cat /etc/system-release
```

Now run the appropriate commands for your version:

<CollectorPkgInstallInstructions kind='yum' />

These repositories are updated by pganalyze whenever a new stable version of the collector is released.
