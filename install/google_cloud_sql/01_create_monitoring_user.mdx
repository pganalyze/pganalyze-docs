We recommend creating a separate monitoring user on your PostgreSQL database for pganalyze.

## Enabling pg_stat_statements

Connect to your database with **cloudsqlsuperuser / alloydbsuperuser** privileges (i.e. the initial user that was created on instance creation), e.g. using `psql`.

Run the following SQL commands to enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension, and make sure it was installed correctly:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1;
```

## Create monitoring user

Connect to the database you will be monitoring, again as a user with **cloudsqlsuperuser / alloydbsuperuser** privileges.
Then run the following to create a monitoring user (we've generated a random password for you, but you
can replace it with one of your choosing):

<MonitoringUserSetupInstructions />

Note that it is important you run these as a user with **cloudsqlsuperuser / alloydbsuperuser** privileges in order to pass down the full access to statistics tables.

## Verify connection

Let's make sure we can connect to the database with the new user:

<VerifyConnection host="1.2.3.4" />

Write down the username and password of the monitoring user, we will use it in the last step of this tutorial.

Next we continue by installing the pganalyze collector:
