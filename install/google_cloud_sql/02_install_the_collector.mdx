To continue, we need to know where you'd like to install the pganalyze collector.

The collector needs to run on a virtual machine or container and be able to reach your Google Cloud SQL or AlloyDB database.

If you used IAM Authentication to create a monitoring user using a service account,
see the section below before installing the collector.

<SelectCollectorPlatform />

### Set up VM for IAM Authentication

If you used IAM Authentication to create a monitoring user using a service account,
you'll need to associate the service account to the VM first.

<GCPConfigureAccess />

If you choose "Use credential file", take a memo of the path to the key file
so that it can be used in the later step of configuring the collector.

Once you associate the service account to the VM, it is important to check access scopes on the VM instance.
Check if it's properly set to `cloud-platform` (or "Allow full access to all Cloud APIs" in the Google Cloud Console, in the API and identity management section).

If not, [follow the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/change-service-account#changeserviceaccountandscopes) to update the access scope to be `cloud-platform`.
