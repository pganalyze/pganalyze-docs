### Create a service account for monitoring user

Cloud SQL supports IAM database authentication, which allows users to connect to the database using Google Cloud IAM credentials instead of traditional passwords.
This means you can use a service account as a monitoring user.

First, create a new service account with the ID "pganalyze", and set the following two roles:
* **Cloud SQL Client** (`roles/cloudsql.client`)
  * Provides connectivity access to Cloud SQL instances
* **Cloud SQL Instance User** (`roles/cloudsql.instanceUser`)
  * Role allowing access to a Cloud SQL instance

The email address `pganalyze@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com` will be given to this service account.
For the database username, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL truncates the `.gserviceaccount.com` suffix in the email,
therefore the username for this service account becomes `pganalyze@your-project-id.iam`.
This username will be used in the later step, as well as in the last step of this tutorial.

### Configure new and existing instances for IAM database authentication

Once the service account for a monitoring user is created, configure the database to monitor for IAM database authentication.
Follow the [Cloud SQL documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-edit-iam-instances) to configure.

You can skip this part if your database is already configured for IAM database authentication.

### Add a service account to a Cloud SQL instance

Next, add a service account to a Cloud SQL instance to monitor. This is a step to create an actual Postgres user using this service account.
Following is the steps to add using the Google Cloud console. Please refer the
[Cloud SQL documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/add-manage-iam-users#creating-a-database-user)
for the other ways to add it.

1. In the Google Cloud console, open the **Overview** page of an instance to monitor.
2. Select **Users** from the SQL navigation menu.
3. Click **Add user account**. The **Add a user account to instance _instance_name_** tab opens.
4. Click the **Cloud IAM** radio button.
5. Add the email address `pganalyze@your-project-id.iam` in the **Principal** field.
6. Click **Add**. The service account is now in the user account list.

### Grant database privileges to the monitoring user and create helper functions

Next, grant database privileges needed for monitoring to the created user, then create helper functions.

Note that it is important you run these as a user with **cloudsqlsuperuser / alloydbsuperuser** privileges in order to pass down the full access to statistics tables.

<MonitoringUserBaseForGCP username="pganalyze@your-project-id.iam" />
<MonitoringUserPerDatabaseHelpers username={'"pganalyze@your-project-id.iam"'} />
