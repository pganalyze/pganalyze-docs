import { MonitoringUserColumnStats } from "../../components/MonitoringUserSetupInstructions";

You may get the following warning when running a collector test:

```
Warning: Limited access to table column statistics detected in database postgres. Please set up the monitoring helper function pganalyze.get_column_stats (https://github.com/pganalyze/collector#setting-up-a-restricted-monitoring-user) or connect as superuser, to get column statistics for all tables.
```

This warning indicates that column statistics for the specific database are not being reported by the collector.
Column statistics are used by pganalyze to improve Index Advisor recommendations. Index Advisor will still work
without the helper functions, but index recommendations may be less accurate.

To resolve this, find the name for the database role that's configured as the monitoring user
in your collector installation (we'll assume "pganalyze" here).

<MonitoringUserColumnStats username="pganalyze" />

Note that unlike other pganalyze helper functions, this function must be installed in *every database* that you
intend to monitor separately.

After creating the helper function in all monitored databases, re-run the collector test to confirm the warning
is no longer displayed.
