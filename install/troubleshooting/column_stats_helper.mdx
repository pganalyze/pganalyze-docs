import { MonitoringUserColumnStats } from "../../components/MonitoringUserSetupInstructions";

You may get the following warning when running a collector test:

```
Warning: Limited access to table column statistics detected in database postgres. Please set up
the monitoring helper function pganalyze.get_column_stats
(https://github.com/pganalyze/collector#setting-up-a-restricted-monitoring-user)
or connect as superuser, to get column statistics for all tables.
```

Or see the following warning in the pganalyze app:

```
Your database appears to be missing column stats monitoring helper functions, which can lead to
inaccurate Index Advisor recommendations. Please review the relevant troubleshooting documentation.
```

This warning indicates that column statistics for the specific database are not
being reported by the collector. Column statistics are used by pganalyze to
improve Index Advisor recommendations. Index Advisor will still work without the
helper functions, but index recommendations may be less accurate.

To resolve this, first, make sure you are running at least collector version
0.41.0 (and ideally the latest version). You can see which version you are
currently running by checking the Debug Info panel on the Server Settings tab of
the Settings page for your server. Then, find the name for the database role
that's configured as the monitoring user in your collector installation (we'll
assume "pganalyze" here).

<MonitoringUserColumnStats username="pganalyze" />

Note that unlike other pganalyze helper functions, this function must be
installed in *every database* that you intend to monitor separately.

After creating the helper function in all monitored databases, re-run the
collector test to confirm the warning is no longer displayed.
