import { MonitoringUserLogRead } from "../../components/MonitoringUserSetupInstructions";

In some environments, it's possible to access Postgres logs by reading them
directly through the Postgres `pg_read_file` function. However, this function is
restricted to Postgres superusers, and since we recommend connecting to your
database from the collector with a restricted monitoring user, it's not directly
available. To work around this, we recommend creating the following helper
function as a superuser (note this needs to be an actual superuser, i.e. not
available on systems like Amazon RDS) and granting access to the monitoring user
(here we assume that user is called "pganalyze"):

<MonitoringUserLogRead username="pganalyze" />

After creating the helper function, re-run the collector test to confirm logs
can be accessed.
