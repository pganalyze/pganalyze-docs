We use the [pg_stat_statements](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgstatstatements.html) extension (officially bundled with PostgreSQL) for tracking which queries get executed in your database.

The query information collected by the extension is cleaned and then sent to our servers using our collector script.

The extension's normalization code cleans the actual values from the queries,<br />
turning ```SELECT * FROM t WHERE secret = '123'``` into ```SELECT * FROM t WHERE secret = ?```.

We still recommend that you use prepared statements if you query for highly sensitive data.

Note: We never collect any stored data, or data returned by queries.

## Install official PostgreSQL contrib package

On your database server, make sure that the extensions package is installed.

Debian/Ubuntu:

Debian/Ubuntu includes `pg_stat_statements` in the main Postgres package,
therefore no additional install is required.

RedHat/CentOS:

```
sudo yum install postgresql-contrib
```

## Configure PostgreSQL

There are a number of settings that define how pg_stat_statements will collect
statistics.
The right configuration will depend on your server, workload, and preferences,
but the following is the example of what to modify.
You can apply these changes by updating your postgresql.conf file.

```
# postgresql.conf
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'

pg_stat_statements.track = all
pg_stat_statements.max = 10000
track_io_timing = on
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Value</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-CONFIG-PARAMS">
          <code>pg_stat_statements.track</code>
        </a>
      </td>
      <td>all (default: top)</td>
      <td>Enables tracking of queries inside stored procedures or functions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-CONFIG-PARAMS">
          <code>pg_stat_statements.max</code>
        </a>
      </td>
      <td>10000 (default: 5000)</td>
      <td>
        Increases the maximum number of statements tracked.
        Recommended to increase further if the database tends to have lots of distinct queries.
        Restart is required for changes to take effect.

        </a>
      </td>
      <td>on (default: off)</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

### The `pg_stat_statements_info` view

Queries that have not been seen recently will be pruned from pg_stat_statements
once `pg_stat_statements.max` is hit. The pruning happens in batches, so you may
see the count lower than the max, even if the max has been reached.
The `dealloc` column of the `pg_stat_statements_info` view tracks the number of
pruned queries. This is useful to check if the `pg_stat_statements.max` should
be increased.

The `pg_stat_statements_info` view, introduced in PostgreSQL 14, tracks the
statistics of pg_stat_statements. In addition to deallocation information, this
view also tracks when the `pg_stat_statements_reset()` function was last called
to reset the statistics.

## Restart the PostgreSQL daemon

If you change `shared_preload_libraries` or `pg_stat_statements.max` above, a restart is required:

```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```
