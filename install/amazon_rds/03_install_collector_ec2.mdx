## Installing the collector on an Amazon EC2 Instance

For this step, you first need to choose whether you want to install the collector on an existing EC2 instance, or run a new one.

The [pganalyze collector](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector) is a daemon process that continuously collects database statistics, and submits them to the pganalyze dashboard in recurring intervals.

You can either run it on a small instance (a `t3.small` suffices), or add it to an existing EC2 instance in your environment.

## Variant A: Starting a new EC2 instance

Start a new `t3.small` instance, Amazon Linux 2 based, that has the IAM role applied:

<p>
  <img src={imgRdsNewInstanceRole} width="694.4" />
</p>

Then follow the step to install the collector on Amazon Linux 2 based instances.

## Variant B: Giving access to an existing EC2 instance

In case you'd like to use an existing EC2 instance, there are two approaches you can choose:

1. Add the IAM policy we created to your existing instance role
2. Create a new IAM user, and manually supply the credentials (using the `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` config options)

If you know AWS a bit these should be straightforward to configure. Please reach out in case you run into issues.

## Installing the collector on the instance

SSH into your EC2 instance. If using an apt-based distribution, run the following to download and install the package:

<CollectorPkgInstallInstructions kind='deb' />

If using an yum-based distribution, run the following to download and install the package:

<CollectorPkgInstallInstructions kind='yum' />

After successful installation the pganalyze collector will now be running in the background on your server.
