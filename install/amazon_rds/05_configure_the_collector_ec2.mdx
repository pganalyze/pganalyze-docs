## Configuring the collector on an Amazon EC2 instance

The collector configuration file lives in `/etc/pganalyze-collector.conf`, and looks like this:

```
[pganalyze]
api_key: your_pga_organization_api_key

[server]
db_host: instance-id.account-id.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
db_name: your_database_name
db_username: your_monitoring_user
db_password: your_monitoring_user_password
db_sslrootcert: rds-ca-2019-root
db_sslmode: verify-full
```

**Fill in the values step-by-step:**

1. <APIKeyInstructions apiKey={props.apiKey} />
2. The `db_host` is the hostname / endpoint of your RDS instance
3. The `db_name` is the database name on the Postgres server you want to monitor
4. The `db_username` and `db_password` should be the monitoring user we created in <Link to='02_create_monitoring_user'>Step 2</Link>
5. The `db_sslrootcert` and `db_sslmode` is the recommended SSL connection configuration that you can usually keep as specified above

**Note:** The pganalyze collector allows for more [optional settings](https://pganalyze.com/docs/collector/settings) (e.g. AWS access keys, multiple database names)

## Test snapshot

Now, verify that the configuration is correct, by running the following command:

```
$ sudo pganalyze-collector --test --reload
