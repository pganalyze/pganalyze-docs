We recommend creating a separate monitoring user on your PostgreSQL database for pganalyze.

Run the following whilst connected as an RDS superuser, replacing `mypassword` with one of your choosing:

<MonitoringUserSetupInstructions />

Note that it is important you run these as RDS superuser in order to pass down the full access to statistics tables.

Write down the username and password of the monitoring user, we will use it in the last step of this tutorial.
