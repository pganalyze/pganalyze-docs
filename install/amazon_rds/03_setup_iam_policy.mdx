Almost done! ðŸŽ‰

We now need to set up an IAM policy and user that the collector can use to access RDS information.

To start, go to **[Create IAM policy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies$new?step=edit)**, select JSON and then paste the following policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:GetLogEvents"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:RDSOSMetrics:log-stream:*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribeDBParameters"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:rds:*:*:pg:*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:DownloadDBLogFilePortion",
                "rds:DescribeDBLogFiles"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:rds:*:*:db:*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribeDBClusters"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:rds:*:*:cluster:*"
        }
    ]
}
```

This policy grants the following access:

- RDS metadata used to discover general instance information
- Cloudwatch metrics to show CPU utilization and other system metrics in pganalyze
- RDS log file download (for [pganalyze Log Insights](https://pganalyze.com/log-insights))

We recommend naming the policy "pganalyze" or similar, so you can easily identify it again.

## Create IAM Role

To complete this step, [create an IAM role](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles$new?step=type)
for pganalyze, and assign the policy to this new role.

For the trusted entity, pick the following:

- Trusted entity type: AWS service
- Use case: EC2

For the permission, choose the policy you just created above.
We recommend also naming the role "pganalyze" or similar.

In the next step we'll download and run the pganalyze collector software to one
of your EC2 instances:
