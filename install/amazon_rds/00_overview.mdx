To monitor your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL servers
with pganalyze, you need to run the pganalyze collector to connect to your
database and send query metadata and other statistics on a continuous basis to
pganalyze.
The collector can be installed directly on an Amazon EC2 instance, with Amazon
ECS, or with Docker.

## Prerequisites

**Database Server**
* Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL server to monitor
* PostgreSQL version 10 or above
* Access with an RDS superuser (master user)
  * Required to create a monitoring user, extensions, and helper functions
  * _This is only required during setup_

**Collector Setup**
* Capability to create an instance for running the collector
  * The collector instance needs be able to connect to RDS or Aurora instances
* Capability to create an IAM policy/role for the collector
  * A new policy/role is required to access to the RDS metadata, Cloudwatch
    metrics, etc.
* A direct connection to the PostgreSQL server
  * The collector instance needs to be able to connect to the server directly,
    bypass any connection poolers like PgBouncer
