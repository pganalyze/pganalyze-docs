To monitor your Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL servers
with pganalyze, you need to install the pganalyze collector on an Amazon EC2
instance, with Amazon ECS, or with Docker.
The collector running in your environment sends query data and other statistics
on a continuous basis to pganalyze.

## Prerequisites

**Database Server**
* Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL server to monitor
* PostgreSQL version is 10 and above
* Access with an RDS superuser (master user)
  * Required to create a monitoring user, extensions, and helper functions
  * _This is only required during setup_

**Collector Setup**
* Capability to create an instance for running the collector
  * The collector instance needs be able to connect to RDS or Aurora instances
* Capability to create an IAM policy/role for the collector
  * A new policy/role is required to access to the RDS metadata, Cloudwatch
    metrics, etc.
