## Installing the collector on an Amazon EC2 Instance

For this step, you first need to choose whether you want to install the collector on an existing EC2 instance, or run a new one.

The [pganalyze collector](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector) is a daemon process that continuously collects database statistics, and submits them to the pganalyze dashboard in recurring intervals.

You can either run it on a small instance (a `t3.small` suffices), or add it to an existing EC2 instance in your environment.

## Starting a new EC2 instance

Start a new `t3.small` instance, Amazon Linux 2 based, that has the IAM role applied:

  <img src={imgRdsNewInstanceRole} width="694.4" />
</p>

Then follow the step to install the collector on Amazon Linux 2 based instances.


## Installing the collector on the instance

<CollectorInstallInstructions apiKey={props.apiKey} />

After successful installation the pganalyze collector will now be running in the background on your server.
