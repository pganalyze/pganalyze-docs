}

## Configuring the collector on an Amazon EC2 instance

The collector configuration file lives in `/etc/pganalyze-collector.conf`, and looks like this:

<ConfigSample apiKey={props.apiKey} />

**Fill in the values step-by-step:**

1. <APIKeyInstructions apiKey={props.apiKey} />
2. The `db_host` is the hostname / endpoint of your RDS instance (for Amazon Aurora you can use the cluster endpoint in many cases, see for details below)
3. The `db_name` is the database name on the Postgres instance you want to monitor
4. The `db_username` and `db_password` should be the monitoring user we created in <Link to='02_create_monitoring_user'>Step 2</Link>
5. The `db_sslrootcert` and `db_sslmode` is the recommended SSL connection configuration that you can usually keep as specified above

**Note:** The pganalyze collector allows for more [optional settings](https://pganalyze.com/docs/collector/settings) (e.g. AWS access keys, multiple database names)

## Handling Amazon Aurora clusters vs instances

In the case of Amazon Aurora, the collector automatically resolves `cluster` endpoints to the underlying writer instance, and `cluster-ro` to the underlying reader instance:

```
[writer_instance]
db_host = mydbcluster.cluster-123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
...

[reader_instance]
db_host = mydbcluster.cluster-ro-123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
...
```

For writer instances this is supported for any size of cluster, but for
reader instances this is only supported in two-node clusters (i.e. single reader instance).

If you have a cluster with multiple readers, you instead need to specify each instance endpoint separately:

```
[instance1]
db_host = mydbinstance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
...

[instance2]
db_host = mydbinstance2.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
...

[instance3]
db_host = mydbinstance3.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
...
```

## Test snapshot

Now, verify that the configuration is correct, by running the following command:

```
$ sudo pganalyze-collector --test
