The [pganalyze collector](https://github.com/pganalyze/collector) is a daemon process that continuously collects database statistics, and submits them to the pganalyze dashboard in recurring intervals.

We recommend installing the collector on an EC2 instance, but you can also run it through a Docker container:

<div className="install-choice">
  <Link className="install-choice--step" to="04_install_collector_ec2">
    <img src="/images/docs/aws-ec2.svg" />
    Amazon EC2 Instance
  </Link>
  <Link className="install-choice--step" to="04_install_collector_ecs">
    <img src="/images/docs/aws-ecs.png" />
    Amazon ECS
  </Link>
  <Link className="install-choice--step" to="04_install_collector_docker">
