In order to setup pganalyze monitoring for Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora for Postgres
you'll need to enable the [pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html)
extension for collecting query statistics.

---

## Enabling pg_stat_statements

Connect to your database as an RDS superuser (usually the credentials you created the database with), e.g. using `psql`.

Run the following SQL commands to enable the extension, and make sure it was installed correctly:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1;
```

This should return one row of query statistics information.

**Important:** If you get the error `pg_stat_statements must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries`,
follow [the troubleshooting document](https://pganalyze.com/docs/install/troubleshooting/rds_pg_stat_statements_shared_preload_libraries).

## Review pg_stat_statements configuration parameters

There are a number of settings that define how pg_stat_statements will collect statistics.
The right configuration will depend on your server, workload, and preferences,
but the following is the example of what to modify.

 Name | New Value | &nbsp;
 ---- | ------ | -------
 [pg_stat_statements.track](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#PGSTATSTATEMENTS-CONFIG-PARAMS) | ALL | Optional, enables tracking of queries inside stored procedures
 [track_io_timing](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html) | 1 | Optional, enables tracking of per-query I/O statistics
 [track_activity_query_size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html) | 2048 | Optional, increases the max size of the query strings Postgres records

Find the [parameter group](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home#parameter-groups:id=)
for your database and apply the settings above.

In case you created a new parameter group you'll have to modify your database to use the Parameter Group you created earlier.

## Enable Enhanced Monitoring

We also highly recommend turning on [Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.overview.html),
if you haven't already - it will give you more detailed system-level statistics
that can be helpful, e.g. to debug I/O issues.

If Enhanced Monitoring is enabled, pganalyze will automatically collect and show
this additional information in the dashboard as well.
