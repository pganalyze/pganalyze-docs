In order to setup pganalyze monitoring for Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora for Postgres
you'll need to enable the [pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html)
extension for collecting query statistics.

---

## Enabling pg_stat_statements

Connect to your database as an RDS superuser (usually the credentials you created the database with), e.g. using `psql`.

Run the following SQL commands to enable the extension, and make sure it was installed correctly:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
{`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;\n
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1;`}
</CodeBlock>

This should return one row of query statistics information.

**Important:** If you get the error `pg_stat_statements must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries`,
follow [the troubleshooting document](https://pganalyze.com/docs/install/troubleshooting/rds_pg_stat_statements_shared_preload_libraries).

## Review pg_stat_statements configuration parameters

See [Configure PostgreSQL section of Enabling pg_stat_statements](https://pganalyze.com/docs/install/01_enabling_pg_stat_statements#configure-postgresql)
for some change recommendations of the pg_stat_statements settings.

With RDS, you can apply these changes with the [Parameter Group](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home#parameter-groups:id=).
for your database and apply the settings above.

## Enable Enhanced Monitoring

We also highly recommend turning on [Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.overview.html),
if you haven't already - it will give you more detailed system-level statistics
that can be helpful, e.g. to debug I/O issues.

If Enhanced Monitoring is enabled, pganalyze will automatically collect and show
this additional information in the dashboard as well.
