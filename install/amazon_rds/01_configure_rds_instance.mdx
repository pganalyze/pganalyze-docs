title: Installation Guide (Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora)
---

In order to setup pganalyze monitoring for Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora for Postgres you'll need to enable the [pg_stat_statements](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/pgstatstatements.html) extension for collecting query statistics.

---

## Enabling pg_stat_statements

Connect to your database as an RDS superuser (usually the credentials you created the database with), e.g. using `psql`.

Run the following SQL commands to enable the extension, and make sure it was installed correctly:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1;
```

**Important:** If you get the error `pg_stat_statements must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries` follow the instructions below. But, if the query returns one row of query statistics we are ready for the next step:

## Getting the "pg_stat_statements must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries" error?

This error indicates that you have not fully enabled pg_stat_statements in your database yet. To enable it, go to your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/), modify your existing custom DB Parameter Group, or create a new custom DB Parameter Group.

In the custom parameter group, modify the `shared_preload_libraries` setting and make sure it includes `pg_stat_statements`.

In case you created a **new** parameter group you'll have to modify your database to use this new parameter group.

To apply the configuration change you will need to reboot your database. Then re-run `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1` and make sure you get a result.
