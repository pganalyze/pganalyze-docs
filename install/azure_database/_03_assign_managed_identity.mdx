### Grant Access to Database

Next, grant access to the DB instance by assigning the role with the created Managed Identity.
Go to the DB instance's page in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select Access Control (IAM).
Click "Add role assignment", then choose the "Monitoring Reader" role. Next, assign access to the created Managed Identity.

<ImgAzureDBAccessControl />
<ImgAddRoleAssignment />

This allows the collector to view the DB instance information, as well as obtain the metrics like CPU usage.
