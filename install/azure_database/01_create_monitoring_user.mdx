import MonitoringUserSetupInstructions from "../../components/MonitoringUserSetupInstructions";
import { generatePassword } from "../../util/password"

export const password = generatePassword()

export const VerifyConnection = ({password}) => {
  return (
    <CodeBlock>PGPASSWORD={password} psql -h mydb.postgres.database.azure.com -d mydatabase -U pganalyze@mydb</CodeBlock>
  )
}

We recommend creating a separate monitoring user on your PostgreSQL database for pganalyze.

As a user with **azure_pg_admin privileges**, connect to the database you will be monitoring
and run the following to create a new user (we've generated a random password for you, but you
can replace it with one of your choosing):

<MonitoringUserSetupInstructions minPostgres={90500} password={password} />

Note that it is important you run these as the Postgres superuser in order to pass down the full access to statistics tables.

## Verify connection

Let's make sure we can connect to the database with the new user:

<VerifyConnection password={password} />

Write down the username and password of the monitoring user, we will use it in the last step of this tutorial.

Next we continue by installing the pganalyze collector:
