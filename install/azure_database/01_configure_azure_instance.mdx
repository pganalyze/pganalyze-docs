In order to set up pganalyze monitoring for [Azure Databse for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql/) you'll need
to first follow these steps to enable the [pg\_stat\_statements](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgstatstatements.html)
extension for collecting query statistics.

This guide assumes you have an already running Azure Database for PostgreSQL server you want to monitor.

---

## Enabling pg\_stat\_statements

In your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), find your DB instance, and open the Server Parameters
page. Filter parameters by `azure.extensions`, and enable `PG_STAT_STATEMENTS`, making sure to save settings.

<ImgAzureServerParams />

Note that this will reboot your database, if you haven't enabled pg\_stat\_statments before.

---

## Verify that pg\_stat\_statements is enabled

Connect to your database as a user with **azure_pg_admin** privileges (usually the credentials you created the database with), e.g. using `psql`.

Run the following SQL commands to enable the extension, and make sure it was installed correctly:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements WITH SCHEMA public;
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1;
```

This should return one row of query statistics information - if it gives an error you might not have restarted your database or changed the configuration correctly.
