We recommend creating a separate monitoring user on your PostgreSQL database for pganalyze.

Run the following to create a new user, whilst connected as a **PostgreSQL superuser**, replacing `mypassword` with one of your choosing:

<MonitoringUserSetupInstructions />

Note that it is important you run these as the Postgres superuser in order to pass down the full access to statistics tables.

## Verify connection

Let's make sure we can connect to the database with the new user:

```
PGPASSWORD=mypassword psql -h localhost -d mydatabase -U pganalyze
```

Write down the username and password of the monitoring user, we will use it in the last step of this tutorial.

Next we continue by enabling pg_stat_statements:
