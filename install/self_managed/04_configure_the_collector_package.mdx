export const APIKeyInstructions = ({ apiKey }) => {
  return apiKey ? (
    <>
      The <code>api_key</code> for the current organization is{" "}
      <code>{apiKey}</code>
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      The <code>api_key</code> can be found in the pganalyze API keys page for
      your organization
    </>
  );
};

## Configuring the collector

The collector configuration file lives in `/etc/pganalyze-collector.conf`, and looks like this:

```
[pganalyze]
api_key: your_pga_organization_api_key

[server]
db_host: localhost
db_name: your_database_name
db_username: your_monitoring_user
db_password: your_monitoring_user_password
```

Fill in the values step-by-step:

1. <APIKeyInstructions apiKey={props.apiKey} />
2. The `db_host` is the hostname of your PostgreSQL instance (usually `localhost`)
3. The `db_name` is the database on the PostgreSQL server you want to monitor
4. The `db_username` and `db_password` should be the credentials of the monitoring user we created in Step 1

## Testing the new configuration

Run the following to make sure the configuration works:

```
sudo pganalyze-collector --test --reload
```
