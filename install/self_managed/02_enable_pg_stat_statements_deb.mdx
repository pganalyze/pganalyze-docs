## Install official PostgreSQL contrib package

On your database server, make sure that the extensions package is installed for your Postgres version:

<PgContribPkgInstallInstructions />

## Enable pg_stat_statements

Run the following SQL statement as a superuser, to enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension:

```
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements';
```

## Restart the PostgreSQL daemon

If you have not used pg_stat_statements before, you will need a full Postgres restart to enable it for the first time:

```
sudo service postgresql restart
```

## Verify that pg_stat_statements returns data

As a superuser, run the following statements:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
SELECT calls, query FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1;
```

If you have configured your database correctly, this will return a result like this:

```
 calls | query
-------+-------
     8 | SELECT * FROM t WHERE field = ?
(1 row)
```

If you get an error you might not have restarted the server. If you get stuck feel free to reach out to us, we're happy to help.
