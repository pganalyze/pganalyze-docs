import CollectorPkgInstallInstructions from '../../components/CollectorPkgInstallInstructions'

export const GuidedSetupInvocationExample = ({ apiKey }) => {
  return (
    <CodeBlock>sudo pganalyze-collector-setup{apiKey && ` --api-key=${apiKey}`}</CodeBlock>
  );
};

To begin guided setup, you'll need to install the collector, which sends statistics information
and query activity to pganalyze.

First, you need to know which version of Ubuntu/Debian you are running. You can find out with this command:

```
lsb_release -a
```

Note that guided setup is supported for Ubuntu 14.04 or newer or Debian 10 or newer. If you are
running an older version, please follow the manual setup instructions.

If your OS distribution is supported, run the appropriate commands for your version:

<CollectorPkgInstallInstructions kind='deb' />

These repositories are updated by pganalyze whenever a new stable version of the
collector is released.

Now check to ensure the installed collector version supports guided setup:

```
pganalyze-collector --version
```

Guided setup is supported starting in version 0.36.

You will need an API key for the install. <PublicOnly>It can be found in the pganalyze Settings page for your organization.</PublicOnly><InAppOnly>It is included in the command below.</InAppOnly>

You'll need to run guided setup as root or using sudo:

<GuidedSetupInvocationExample apiKey={props.apiKey} />

You'll be shown additional instructions, and prompted to confirm any changes to your system.
