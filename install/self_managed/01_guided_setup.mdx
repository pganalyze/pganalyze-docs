To begin guided setup, you'll need to install the collector, which sends statistics information
and query activity to pganalyze.

Note that guided setup is supported for Ubuntu 14.04 or newer or Debian 10 or newer. If you are
running an older version, please follow the manual setup instructions.

You will need an API key for the install. <PublicOnly>It can be found in the pganalyze Settings page for your organization.</PublicOnly><InAppOnly>It is included in the command below.</InAppOnly>

To install the collector and start guided setup, run the following command:

<GuidedSetupInvocationExample apiKey={props.apiKey} />

You'll be shown additional instructions, and prompted to confirm any changes to your system.
