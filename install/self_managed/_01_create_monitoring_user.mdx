import MonitoringUserSetupInstructions from "../../components/MonitoringUserSetupInstructions";

export const VerifyConnection = ({password}) => {
  return (
    <CodeBlock>PGPASSWORD={password} psql -h localhost -d mydatabase -U pganalyze</CodeBlock>
  )
}

We recommend creating a separate monitoring user on your PostgreSQL database for pganalyze.

Connect to the database you will be monitoring as a **PostgreSQL superuser**.
Then run the following to create a new user (we've generated a random password for you, but you
can replace it with one of your choosing):

<MonitoringUserSetupInstructions password={props.password} />

Note that it is important you run these as the Postgres superuser in order to pass down the full access to statistics tables.

## Verify connection

Let's make sure we can connect to the database with the new user:

<VerifyConnection password={props.password} />

Write down the username and password of the monitoring user, we will use it in the last step of this tutorial.

Next we continue by enabling pg_stat_statements:
