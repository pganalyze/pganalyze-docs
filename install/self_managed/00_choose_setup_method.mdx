To monitor a new Postgres server with pganalyze, you must make some configuration changes
to your database and install and run the pganalyze collector. There are two
ways of doing this: manually stepping through our instructions, or running the guided
setup program included with the collector, which will prompt you for input and confirmation
and make the necessary changes on your behalf.

The guided setup program is in a pilot stage and we do not recommend using it on production
systems yet. However, it's a simpler way to get started on development sytems.

If your system meets the following criteria

 * Ubuntu 14.04 or newer, or Debian 10 or newer
 * Postgres 10 or newer
 * Collector installed on the same system as your Postgres server
 * Not a production system

We recommend trying the guided setup program. Otherwise, you'll need to follow the manual
setup instructions. We plan to expand the configurations supported for guided setup soon.
