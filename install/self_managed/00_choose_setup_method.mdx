To monitor a new Postgres server with pganalyze, you must make some configuration changes
to your database and install and run the pganalyze collector. There are two
ways of doing this:

 * **manual setup**: step through our instructions, making changes yourself
 * **guided setup**: run a setup program which will prompt you for input and confirmation
and make necessary changes on your behalf

The guided setup program is a simpler way to get started on supported systems, and can also
set up [Automated EXPLAIN](https://pganalyze.com/postgres-explain) and
[Log Insights](https://pganalyze.com/log-insights) for you.

We recommend trying the guided setup program if your system **meets the following criteria**:

 * Ubuntu 14.04 or newer, or Debian 10 or newer
 * Postgres 10 or newer
 * Collector installed on the same system as your Postgres server

Otherwise, you'll need to follow the manual setup instructions. We plan to expand the
configurations supported for guided setup soon.
