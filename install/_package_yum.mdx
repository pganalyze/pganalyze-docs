Run the following commands as root on your server:

```
echo "[pganalyze_collector]
name=pganalyze_collector
baseurl=https://packages.pganalyze.com/el/7
repo_gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://packages.pganalyze.com/pganalyze_signing_key.asc
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
metadata_expire=300" >> /etc/yum.repos.d/pganalyze_collector.repo

yum makecache
yum install pganalyze-collector
```

**The above configuration is for RHEL 7 and Amazon Linux 2.**

If you use a different distibution you can replace "el/7" with either "el/6" or "fedora/24" to get the correct package.

These repositories are updated by pganalyze whenever a new stable version of the
collector is released.
