In this step we set up
[pg_stat_statements](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgstatstatements.html),
which is used by pganalyze to collect Postgres query statistics.

## Enable pg_stat_statements

Connect to the primary database you will be monitoring as **avnadmin** and run
the following SQL statement to enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```


## Verify that pg_stat_statements returns data

As **avnadmin**, run the following statement:

```
SELECT calls, query FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE userid = current_user::regrole LIMIT 1;
```

If you have configured your database correctly, this will return a result like this:

```
 calls | query
-------+-------
     8 | SELECT * FROM t WHERE field = ?
(1 row)
```
