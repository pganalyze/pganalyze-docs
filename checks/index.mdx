To help you discover potential problems, pganalyze automatically performs a number
of checks on your database.

Checks run regularly, at different frequencies depending on the check type. When
a problem is detected, an issue is created for the server or database where the
problem is found.

Issues may have severity "info", "warning", or "critical". Critical issues may
cause a serious performance problem or lead to a database outage within a matter
of hours. Warnings are less serious, but should still be investigated as they can
often escalate to critical severity. Info-level issues encourage best practices and
indicate opportunities for performance improvements.


## Alerting

If an issue is of severity "critical" (either because it starts as critical or
escalates to that level), it will alert organization users according to their
configured Alert Policy. You can edit Alert Policies in the Configure section
of the Alerts & Check-Up page. You can edit organization members' assigned
policies in each member's organization profile page, accessible from the Members
section of the organization Settings page.


## Checks

Checks are organized into several different categories:
