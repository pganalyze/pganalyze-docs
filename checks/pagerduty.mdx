## PagerDuty + pganalyze Integration Benefits

 * Notify on-call responders based on alerts sent from pganalyze
 * Link PagerDuty incidents to issue details in pganalyze
 * Automatically acknowledge PagerDuty incidents when issues are acknowledged in pganalyze
 * Automatically resolve PagerDuty incidents when pganalyze detects an issue has been resolved

## How it Works

In order to ensure your database is running smoothly, pganalyze runs a number of checks every time
it receives statistics snapshots about your database from the [Collector](/docs/collector).
These checks can create issues in pganalyze, which you can view by navigating to the **Alerts & Check-Up**
page in the left menu in pganalyze. Once the underlying problem has been resolved, pganalyze will
automatically resolve the issue.

Integration with PagerDuty can trigger incidents on a PagerDuty service when new critical issues are
created (or when existing issues escalate to critical severity). Once a pganalyze issue has been resolved,
the associated PagerDuty incident will be automatically resolved as well.


## Requirements

In order to set up the initial integration with PagerDuty, you will need [modify permissions](/docs/permissions)
on the pganalyze organization. In order to configure alerts for a specific server, you will need **modify**
permissions on that server.


## Support

If you need help with this integration, please contact [support@pganalyze.com](mailto:support@pganalyze.com).


## Integration Walkthrough

Follow these instructions for your selected organization in pganalyze.


### Initial setup

Before configuring alerts, you will need to connect your pganalyze organization to PagerDuty:

1. In the top menu, click the **x** in the **Server** dropdown if a server is selected to clear the active server
2. In the left menu, click the **Settings** item
3. On the organization settings page, click the **Integrations** tab
4. In the panel labeled **PagerDuty**, click the **Connect to PagerDuty** button
5. Continue to authenticate with PagerDuty and select which services you would like to connect to pganalyze
   * Services you select will later be available to configure for alerting; no alerting is enabled by default
6. Once connected, select a service from the dropdown and click **Test integration** to trigger a test alert
   to the selected service and verify that the integration is configured correctly


### Configuring alerts

1. In the top menu, use the **Server** dropdown to select the server to configure
2. In the left menu, click the **Alerts & Check-Up** item
3. On the server alerts page, click the **Configure** tab
4. Click the **Configure alerts for this server** link
5. Select a service from the **PagerDuty service** dropdown
6. Check the checkboxes in the **PagerDuty Alert** column for the checks you would like to enable
   * Only checks which escalate to critical severity will be selectable
7. Click the **Save Changes** button
8. You should see "Success! Configuration changes saved" and pganalyze will create incidents the next time any of
   the configured checks trigger

Note: If you change the configuration to disable PagerDuty alerts for some checks while there are open
incidents, you will need to resolve these incidents manually.


### Uninstalling the integration

1. In the top menu, click the **x** in the server dropdown if a server is selected to clear the active server
2. In the left menu, click the **Settings** item
3. On the organization settings page, click the **Integrations** tab
4. In the panel labeled **PagerDuty**, click the **Reset integration** button
5. You should see "Success! Reset complete!" and the integration will be removed

Note: If you uninstall the PagerDuty integration while there are open incidents, you will need to resolve
these incidents manually.

### Resetting the integration

If you would like to change the PagerDuty services you connect with pganalyze, go through the uninstall steps
and the initial setup steps. Your alerting configuration will be maintained. If your alerting configuration
references channels that no longer exist, you will need to update these manually or contact [support@pganalyze.com](mailto:support@pganalyze.com).
